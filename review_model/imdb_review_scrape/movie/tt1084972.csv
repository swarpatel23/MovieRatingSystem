" Wanted Lives up to expectation","When i watched the movie i expected a lot as i am a big fan of Salman Khan. The story of the movie moves along at a good pace, and you never really guess what is going on until it happens. I don't want to give away too much for those people who haven't watched the movie. Aisha Takia looks sexy as always, in my opinion she is very under rated in the business.is a story that will not be new to most regular bollywood movie watchers the twist is very good.Salman Khan looks very big in the movie and they show him as a Herculean man who can beat up any1. this look suits salman very well.Overall it is a movie which i would recommend it has some good action sequences and the story is also quite entertaining." 
" Entertainment Guaranteed","Wanted,remake of Pokkiri.Both directed by Prabhu Deva and surprisingly both turned to be a winner at the box office. Wanted turned to be a winner for various reasons-1.)It was released during the Eid period. 2.)The promos were outstanding. 3.)The film was promoted heavily. 4.)The songs were a craze among people. 5.)And the prime reason Salman KhanWanted is a total entertainer.It is loud,it is humorous,it is violent,it is amusing. Prabhu Deva succeeds in making an entertainer. The music is superb. The dialogs are perfect. The action sequences are superb.Performance wise-Salman Khan is revelation.Ayesha Takia is cute.The chemistry between Salman and Ayesha is good.Mahesh Manjrekar is first-rate.Prakash Raj is excellent.Overall Wanted is high on entertainment but lacks story." 
" A complete Paisa Vasool","Honestly, when I saw the promos I had no expectations at all. But after watching Wanted, all I can say that it is a real nice movie. It takes you back to the glorious 80s, where our hero used to beat up dozens of gundas all alone, save his girlfriend from gundas, over the top mannerisms, etc. It is a perfect example of a old wine in a new bottle. The truth is that our Bollywood had lost its innocence, trying too hard to imitate the west, making so called art/serious movies aka parallel cinema. Masala movies were almost finished. But I hope this has revived them again, because the movie was very much enjoyable.Action scenes are OTT at times, but still enjoyable.It has some nice performances, but it is Sallu bhai that carries the movie on his shoulders. No other actor in Bollywood could have pulled the role with such an ease. Because of him you just overlook at the flaws.Ayesha Takia looks stunning and her chemistry with Sallu does work! Vinod is not given enough footage but manages to do well.Mahesh Manjrekar is brilliant. He was just too good at times. Typical corrupt lusty police officers. Scene where he is on his laptop or any other scene... Really good.Prakash Raj deserves special mention. He was just amazing as the DON. Amazing in the jail scenes!The twist in the movie was quite nice and not really expected. (as I haven't seen the original) There are some really funny scenes in first half as well =DThe movie has almost no story, but the screenplay was nice.The only thing that was quite annoying was the amount of unnecessary songs. It got boring, because It was like fight scene - song - fight scene - song... Just like those 80s movies, but quite exaggerated. I wish there were bit less songs.Best scenes:Lift scene with Salman and Ayesha - All Mughal-e-Azam scenes - In the basketball court - Jail scenes with Don - Radhe asking for Jhanvi phone number in the train - Radhe ignoring Jhanvi - Where Rajeev Shikawat's identity is revealed - The scene where Don meets Srikanth Shikawat (Vinod Khanna)and many more. I can say that most of the scenes (except the scenes with the landlord - the guy was funny in beginning but got annoying by the end) are really good and most of them are memorable.In one word, it is a PAISA VASOOL. Leave your brains at home, watch and enjoy with friends.8/10 (revival of the glorious 80s)" 
" Salman Khan proves his star Power","This movie is undoubtedly the most entertaining movie of 2009.Hats off to Salman Khan. He definitely looks like a ferocious lion. The pace of the movie is the important thing to notice about. It will make you to watch the movie for more times.This movie is definitely meant for the masses with cool dialogs. Style of the movie is excellent.Last 30 minutes of the movie will make you go wild.Salman khan excels in this role.Apart from him, look out for Prakash Raj. He has done 200% justice to the villain's role.The critic's reviews and the audience's reactions proves the success of this movie." 
" Ghajini is so 2008......!!!!!","This is my first ever movie review on IMDb. I am a huge movie buff but too lazy to post my views about them here. Finally, I am writing for my Superstar, our Superstar, India's Superstar, The Only Superstar - Salman Khan.I just returned from the night show and boy I was entertained. I have been Salman's fan since his very first flick - Maine Pyar Kiya. I think I am his biggest fan alive. Have seen Andaz Apna Apna over 35 times and still watch it whenever I have the time. But, Salman's recent movies were heartbreakingly disappointing. Like many of his other fans too I was praying and hoping that Wanted would deliver much much and much much more.I was not disappointed this time and boy am I happy at that. The movie starts off well and holds its pace throughout. All the characters played their parts well. The songs were good, although I was disappointed at Ishq Vishq being cut off. The fight sequences were mind blowing. Ayesha looked cute as ever. Overall I would give Wanted a 10/10 as it has everything that a Bollywood movie buff and hardcore Salman fan would expect.Some people think that they are too far above the so called "Masses". For them, movies for the masses are not good enough and they feel ashamed to praise such a movie, coz it does not have SRK dancing around a girl in foreign locations. For me, Wanted is a superb film, even if it's for the masses - I am a part of the masses - ain't I. Still these over the moon film critics go to see - "Ayesha Takia's big, big goodies" which for them - "are a treat to watch."Finally, Ghajini (with due respect to it) looks so 2008 now ;)" 
" 'Wanted' is really wanted.. a must watch","Most of you must be knowing that 'Wanted' is remake of Telugu 'Pokiri'. The Telugu version was itself a great.. so any remake will be delighting. And Prabhu Deva has not made much wear and tear to its original version. That makes 'Wanted' a full entertaining movie. After watching the first show, I expect most will like it and hopefully Salman's wanted will turn out to be a super-hit. Acting was awesome. Most of the crew have performed their role to perfection. Ayesha Takia was at her best. Prakash Raj has proved again and again that he can play any role flawless. Better can be expected from a star like Salman Khan. The bar of expectation risen high enough by a near perfect Mahesh Babu in the original 'Pokiri'. Salman has not done bad anyway. Songs do dishearten. Last but not the least the plot is superb that makes this movie so wonderful. My verdict: a must watch." 
" one of the best performances by salman....","wanted is an out and out action flick and i think its one of the best action films ever made in bollywood.movie showcases salman as never before as stylish hit-man who kills for money only .and believe me he does it tonear perfection .in fact its one of his best performances tilldate...ayesha takia is cute. the movie could have done without one or two songs to reduce the runtime.On the whole, WANTED rides on Salman, Salman and only Salman Khan's star power. A masala film that's aimed at the masses. This is for fans and foes of Salman Khan... Fans, rejoice, Salman is back with a vengeance with WANTED. This is his deadliest performance to date. Foes won't be able to lash out at him or pick on him or launch a vicious tirade this time. The spate of flops should come to a grinding halt with WANTED." 
" Prabhudeva's unstoppable force - Salman Khan!","Wanted is Salman Khan's most definitive statement to the film world. If ShahRukh Khan can give an Om Shanti Om and Aamir Khan can give a Ghajini to the masses, he can give something even more explosive and entertaining. Yes, Salman Khan tops other Khans in this South Indian film inspired - action packed explosion that is directed by Prabhudeva, the accomplished choreographer. Salman doesn't have his over-the-top accent or his fake tears to accompany him in this venture that takes him from a tapori to a ruthless terminator of the underworld. Wanted is exaggerated, preposterous and laughable but that is exactly what it was meant to be. Prabhudeva has strong roots in South Indian cinema where action is fast paced with jerky camera motions that send everyone flying high but to incorporate all this into an entertaining movie deserves some pat on his back. He may not be a renowned film maker but he knows exactly what it takes to deliver an explosive action movie and boy does he do it in style!Radhe (Salman Khan) is a tapori who can commit himself to any task for the money involved to the extent that he wouldn't even listen to himself and he means it. Ayesha Takia is his love interest that never gets in his way of killing goons and fighting his way through the day. Where the heroine of a film can easily distract the plot and hero, Prabhudeva manages to keep her role restricted to songs and light hearted relief after a heavy doze of action. Just like his character, Salman Khan is a one man army in the movie. His performance, action and even Prabhudeva - choreographed dancing is the heart and soul of the film. Wanted is easily one of his best performances that has encompassed all that he is capable of doing (excluding comedy). While the romantic breaks and songs are nothing more than a restroom or samosa break for the viewer, the action is relentless and even though it is over-the-top in typical South Indian film style, it is nevertheless, kick-ass and ruthless! If Hollywood can be proud of Tarantino's Kill Bill style of action, then we must be proud of Prabhudeva's version of stylized action. We are not talking about realistic fight sequences or martial arts but of what we remember Sunny Deol's movies for - ruthless, high octane, one man show of just knocking the man down with fists, kicks, guns or whatever comes in our hero's hands. There is no mercy in showcasing blood and gore because when we see Salman Khan all charged up to deliver the other guy straight to hell, we can see him as the Terminator without an automatic weapon. He is an unstoppable force who is not deterred by Police, gangs, underworld, knives, guns or sharp objects. He just flings them right back in Rajnikant style and that is what makes this movie even more enjoyable. Just go watch it with this notion in mind that it is a Rajnikant style action film but made in Bollywood with Salman Khan taking on whatever comes in his way and you shall then be entertained.Prabhudeva leaves no chapter out from the book of 'how to make a masala movie' with a non-stop delivery of excitement with occasional humour, romance, songs, drama, reality, action and unbelievable heroics. He makes Salman perform every ritual that we can expect and not expect. Who knew that the 'sturdy' Salman could dance with such flexibility and style in love me?? He acts fearless against the biggest Don, challenges and embarrasses Policemen, reaches Andheri station even before the train gets there, is available wherever his need arises, shows no mercy to anyone who inflicts harm upon his family or his loved one and yes, of course, he takes his shirt off while doing so as well! The film may be a bit too long and the random songs on international hotspots maybe unwarranted but when we see Salman as an unstoppable force, we know it's clobbering time! Salman hasn't lost his position in Bollywood and with Wanted, he asserts himself in the most convincing manner. The masses will love it because the film was made for them but overall, it's entertainment that comes with its warnings. Prabhudeva, from down South, delivers what many Hindi film directors have failed on countless attempts. An entertaining action flick with all the masala to add to your popcorn.-7.44 on a scale of 1-10." 
" A Good Action and Romantic Movie","This was a surprise in waiting – good action movie that will keep you seated in your seat and make you enjoy watching it. A arrogant, ruthless, sharp shooter and a gangster, who works for a "Don," on his own terms and has no emotions, becomes a killing machine as he starts killing his boss's enemies but then he sees a beautiful woman. At the same time he has enemies.Starring Salman Khan, Ayesha Takia, Mahesh Manrekar, Vinod Khanna, Om Puri and Sayaji Shinde, this is directed by Prabhudeva and is produced by Boney Kapoor. The music score is provided by Sajid Wajid while Salim Suleiman also provide a good back ground score. Anil Kapoor and Govinda make a special appearance.The first half contains some comedy along with romance and action and this makes it a good combination to watch but the second half is more action orientated. Salman Khan has suited the role very well and it makes it a change to see him in action after a long time, though he does remove his shirt, while Ayesha Takia, has improved once again. The other actors also make a good contribution to this movie as does Vinod Khanna in a supporting role and whose character really pushes the story to its climax. Some songs are memorable and are worth listening to and the cinematography is also worth watching.Director Prabhudeva has done a good job in directing this romantic, action movie with added small dose of comedy.Some may find this too violent but it is a movie that can be watched with your family and is worth watching." 
" Has its heart in the right place","Although not the masterpiece Salman Khan fans proclaim it to be, Wanted is definitely one of the better masala films to come out in ages. I say this not due to the lack of masala films because of the pretentiousness that has overcome Hindi cinema in producing "realistic" cinema, but because Wanted is truly one of the better masala films to come out in the past few years. People have claimed this to be Salman's best performance but I respectfully disagree. This definitely is one his better performances in the past few years, but Salman can be an extraordinary actor under the right circumstances as is evident from Andaz Apna Apna. The actors are all doing what they are supposed to be, but none of them truly excel. However, what truly impressed me about this film is its confidence in what it wants to show us, and its self awareness about how ridiculous it is. This is especially evident during the shining teeth scene as well as the talked about scene with Prakash Raj. I won't spoil them for you here, but take my word for it; THEY ARE FRICKIN HILARIOUS. Secondly, the action scenes as with the rest of the movie are amazingly ridiculous when it comes to realism, but they are ridiculously fun nonetheless.Coming to the flaws, well it is ridiculous and despite it knows it is and even makes fun of itself, there is no denying that it is distracting. Also, the plot is wafer thin. However, the twist in the end in my opinion more than does its share in setting the plot apart. All of this adds up to one thing, Wanted is ridiculously preposterous but what sets it apart is that it knows it. Not only should Salman fans watch this, but so should everyone else to get a real sense of a masala film done right. (In regards with Ghajini VS Wanted that seems to circling the media these days, I believe Wanted to be the better film. Firstly, because as far as I know, it is not a rip off, and secondly, despite they are both unabashed about their OTT ness, Wanted has a sense of self awareness and heart that is unfortunately sorely lacking in Hindi cinema these days.)" 
" Unlike others..i would say wanted is really wanted....","Great style, action, acting, comedy, love story....this film seems to have got everything.The movie is paced properly and hats off to Prabhudeva for his direction. The songs and dance sequences are superb.Salman has really worked hard on this film...and its paid off well. Man the ways hes danced, moved, acted, done the action part...marvellous....superb...extra-ordinaire...Ayesha looks cute and cool...(have liked her so much for the 1st time, how come i did not notice her earlier). Mahesh Manjrekar has put on a role up there....what a class bad act....way to go...Shivaji Raje...All in all one grand entertainer....this is the one that swept away the floor beneath me after Ghajini.Salman..infinite cheers!!! Though i am not a big fan of yours....lately i am liking you day by day by your work both socially and in films." 
" Non-Stop Fighting & Dancing.....","Prabhu Deva's 'Wanted' is strictly, strictly, strictly meant for the hoi polloi.Remake of a Telugu hit,'Wanted' reminds of 80's cinema of bollywood. Fights, Violence... Songs, Romance, Emotional Melodrama, ha 'Wanted' is so outdated. But no doubt, a film like 'Wanted' still manages an audience, as mentioned the film is aimed for the masses & only them. The clap-worthy one-liners, the mar-dhard... all this is pleasing, for them at least.On the flip side, There's hardy any story. One fight scene, One song, One fight scene, One song. A wafer-thin plot that gets dragging, especially post interval. Plus, the violence and chillam-chili is too much after a certain point. Songs are good to hear, but pop-up for no reason.Performances: Salman is as usual, though his continuity is inconsistent. In songs he sports long hair, while other-wise a military cut. Ayesha Takia's big, big goodies are a treat to watch. Mahesh Manjrekar is fantastic as the conniving cop. Prakash Raj is funny, especially in the scene when he tries to escape from the cops, the aftermath is truly hilarious. Vinod Khanna deserved more footage. Inder Kumar, Sajid & Kader Khan's son are good in their parts. Mahek looks hot. Manoj Phawa tries hard to make you laugh, but succeeds at times nevertheless. Assem Merchant, Raju Mawani & others are okay.on the whole, watch 'Wanted'... but don't forget to leave your brains at home." 
" Wanted too good- Rhadey is back","Salman reprises his role as Rhadey and boost his dying career again in my opinion. Its time for Prem to take a break and Rhadey to break bones and set new trends in bollywood.This film wonderfully crafted and the actors and actress do an amazing job. I do applaud Vinod Khanna, the forever hard man of Bollywood. The scenario's are nicely collated the affects suit the genre of the film and the acting does justice to the characters.Like all of bollywood films and the big stars excluding Amir Khan the acting has become poor as they expect hits from their simple appearance in a film. This is true on the majority of films as most bollywood movie fans adopt a favourite actor and will no matter what what their films. In my household we have Akshay Kumar and Shahrukh fans - no matter how bad the film, reviewed it must be watched at cinema.I think this film will bring Salman closer to success as he will regain confidence in his acting and will make more an effort to deliver.This type of movie differs from conventional Indian movies and thus creates a new market which salman possibly akshay could exploit further and enhance their acting to what it once was.I would love to give this film 10/10 but there were moments were it could have been enhanced even further for the action fans of bollywood." 
" Salman was NEVER gone","Wanted.... a movie many of us have been waiting for. It has already been declared the biggest blockbuster of 2009. I just got back from this movie and I just have to say one thing : THIS, is what Salman Khan is about!One movie in which you get it all! ; Marvelous acting, awesome comic timing, fantastic dance moves, good performed action!All done by the one and only Salman Khan!Let me start off telling about the story, though it's not the best ever story around, the story is good. Different than the usual boy-meets-girl stories. The story is about gangs and the underworld dons v/s each other v/s the police. Prabhudeva proves he not only has dance talent, but also amazing story telling abilities. The story was told very differently, other than the usual underworld movies bollywood has produced (Sanjay Dutt movies. The movie has a lot of comic moments, they were not over the top.. just perfect enough to make you laugh! Though I have a slight complaint against the songs that just popped op at places, the melodious music and great choreography made me forget the problem.Ayesha Takia hasn't forgotten how to act for sure, she not only looks great, but acts very well too! I sure hope this lady continues acting even though there are rumours about her quitting acting.Prakash Raj as Ghani Bhai has done the role very convincingly. The scene where he's not supposed to sleep is simply hilarious!Mahesh Manjrekar is effective as the very corrupt bastard cop. He ones again proves how versatile he is.And now... SALMAN KHAN... the man that made this movie what it is. Wanted is a pure Salman movie, the movie shines because of him. He's done the role exceptionally well. Though Salman hasn't seen many commercial successes the past few years.. I personally believe things will go very smooth for him post Wanted! I am very satisfied with Wanted and look forward to Salmans future releases! THUMBS UP WANTED!P.S. Wanted.. Salmans comeback vehicle? Hell no, are you telling me he was gone?" 
" One of the best movies of 2009","When I read the reviews about the film (mostly favorable), I had high expectations about it, and I have to say, I wasn't disappointed. Prabhudeva, the dancing guru, starting his career as a director with a bang.It's all about this hardcore gangster Radhe (Salman Khan), who can just about kill anyone who gets in his way. He is working for Don Gani (Prakash Raj). Later, he meets Jhanvi (Ayesha Takia), and eventually they fall in love with each other. Then, the film takes an unpredictable turn of events, to the climax, which is absolutely amazing.Salman Khan, in his second best performance to date (first being Andaaz Apna Apna), really carries the film on his shoulders with the gangster image. He should really stick to roles like this one. Ayesha Takia does a good job as Jhanvi. Prakash Raj essays the role of Gani Bhai, was OK in the first half as we didn't get to see a lot of him, but does a fantastic job in the second half. Mahesh Manjrekar is good as the corrupt cop. Vinod Khanna is OK, and the guy who play Sonu Gates in the film is brilliant as the comic character.The action is fantastic, being compared to that of Ghajini's, which was fantastic as well. Direction was good, and everything was good.But the biggest let-down was the music. Although some of them pretty catchy (Love me, Love me, Jalwa etc), I felt they weren't really required in the film. The story is OK, so if you are looking for any logic in the film, don't bother showing up. This is an all out action packed film.This should be the best movie of 2009, but will be tough, as there are other really good films like Kaminey and Love aaj kal." 
" A must watch for action fans! Unmissable for Salman fans!","The movie itself is a good piece of work. The dialogues are good and so is the script. You have to remember that it is a remake of the Telegu film Pokiri, but i feel it does justice to the original. Nobody could have played the leading role played by mahesh babu in 'pokiri' better than Salman Khan, who the only action hero in bollywood at present. This is the career best for Ayesha Takia, who plays the female lead in this film. Others such as Vinod Khanna, Govind Namdeo and Prakash Raj are also good in the film. The music is also decent. The two tracks that stand out are 'Jalwa' and 'Love me love me'. The dialogues, delivered in typical fashion by Salman Khan, are also good. As an action fan, i really liked it.My verdict: unmissable for Salman and action fans. 9.5/10"
