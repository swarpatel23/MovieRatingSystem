" A shining comedy that celebrates its madness; hilarious is an understatement.","Aatish Kapadia's Khichdi: The Movie is based on the popular TV series directed by Kapadia himself. I have not seen the series, but the movie is fantastic. Centring around the crazy Parekh family, it is one of the maddest and funniest Indian films I've seen in recent years. It is terribly mad, but it is terribly entertaining. It is mindless, senseless, brainless, over-the-top, insane and ludicrous, but it's just one movie that hooks the audience from the very first moment and for two hours keeps them laughing non-stop. The viewers do not have to think too much but they will certainly find themselves rolling on the floor on numerous occasions. Well, that's at least what happened to me. One thing is sure: Khichdi is silly, but it actually celebrates its silliness and thus manages to create one truly unforgettable laugh riot.Aatish Kapadia both writes and directs this feature, and he does a good job of it. The movie is also very well cast, with every actor understanding the film's outrageously comic mood and acting accordingly. Supriya Pathak leads the film as the dumb Hansa with a terrific performance that is downright hilarious. Her screen presence is the strongest in the film; when she's on-screen, no one else exists, when she is not, you badly want her to reappear. Rajeev Mehta, Nimisha Vakharia, Jamnadas Majethia and Anang Desai play their roles excellently. What I liked about the film is the fact that it is not an unintentional comedy, it's a well-scripted picture which knows how it wants to work. To sum it up, Khichdi is an outstanding no-brainer and for me it is also quite addictive. I already want to watch it again." 
" Khichdi.....great comedy movie","So I went to Khichdi. My friends told its good comedy TV series but I always steered clear of any TV serials. Had no idea about it. And that was a boon for me.The movie is two hours long and I don't remember when is the last time I've laughed two hours continuously. Its slapstick comedy with over-the-top disaster scenes. Hansa-Prafull jodi is superb!!! both the actors are gem. In every scene they made fun of conventional thinking and filming. Every dialog in every scene is exact opposite of what should be if it was real life. Hat's off to the writer, director and Khichdi acting cast for gifting such a laugh riot. Want sequels of it.P.S. got the TV series after watching the movie. Enjoying them thoroughly. How could I missed it earlier......" 
" Outrageously funny movie ever made for Indian audience!","KHICHADI - Hindi movie (2010) - DON'T WATCH THIS MOVIE IF YOU ARE A HEART PATIENT.Thanks God I am Alive.. I could have died.. Died LAUGHING...First time in my life I had to pause the movie frequently to control my laughter. I assure, even if someone gets a heart attack watching this movie he'd laugh on his way to hospital until doc gives him anesthesia! But then he will remember the hospital sequence from the movie and he'd surely die!Outrageously funny movie ever made for Indian audience. Character that can kill you is called Praful. .."Mein hun praful.. praful hu mein.." ROFLMFAO!! ï»¿ It starts with an intro story in which God visits the maddest family in the world to give 'Akkal ke laddu' but returns back helplessly after being accused 'Pata nahi kisney tumhe Bhagwaan banaya!'There on laughter just doesn't leave you. Its very few times in your life you just cant help yourself laughing and try too hard but it just gets doubled. This movie is one of those. Theater equivalent experience of brilliant performances!Watch it :)" 
" Highly recommended!!","Imagine yourself laughing uncontrollably watching a movie, almost blocking your breath, and when you reach a state that you can't hold it anymore, you may choke, and you 'pause' the movie for a while, relax, and 'resume' the movie again, just to laugh uncontrollably and choke again. If you want to experience this, watch 'Khichdi. It is a complete laugh riot, that the we feel that the words like 'LOL'(Laugh out Loud) and 'ROFL'(Rolling on Floor, Laughing) were made to describe this movie. It is truly a laughter ride, the Khichdi family makes you laugh like you had never been, before!!Khichdi is a simple movie, without big stars. It is the film version of a TV series of the same name, and the same characters are retained in the movie. The movie is about Hansa, Praful, Himanshu, Jayshree, Babuji, and around 50 Parminders. The PJs of these people will make you die laughing, for around 110 minutes of your life!! Watch the movie, you will know.I love PJs and jokes even more stupid than PJs, and I always wanted to be a good PJist, and was proud of my PJs. I also believed no one can beat my standard in PJs. But, after watching Khichdi I realised that I have to raise my PJ standards immediately. This movie goes to a level which is beyond your imagination. If you are a PJ lover, this is the real treat for you. I'm sure you will rate it a minimum of 8/10. It is obvious, because the makers have added so much of PJs in the movie.We see comedy movies becoming great successes, with double meaning comedies. Often it is not so comfortable to watch such movies with our family. But this Khichdi is purely green, and you can watch it with your kids, parents, or even grandparents.There is a cold war between the characters of the movie, to prove that who is more stupid. Hansa, Himanshu and Praful all the three of them behave so stupidly, that we can't make a conclusion on who is more stupid. Obviously, all of them are damn funny too. Supriya Pathak is in her extreme form, and is great in each and every scene. After a simple 'Maa' role in 'Wake Up Sid', she does a character with a completely new flavour, and she is extremely successful in this role. Rajeev Mehta is first rate as Praful. He is better than most of the comedians of bollywood, and his gestures and expressions are fantastic. Jamnadas Majethia is very good as Himanshu. He is also damn funny, and is excellent. Anang Desai and Nimisha Vakharia are good in their respective roles as Babuji and Jayshree. The new girl who played 'Parminder' was cute. The cameos by Farah Khan and Satish Shah were good. There are many situations in the movie, which will make the entire house down. Few of them are:1. The 'Akal ke Ladoo' scene 2. Funeral scene 3. The night scene in Chhedi Singh's house 4. The hospital scene 5. The entire court sceneOn the whole, Khichdi is a complete entertainer, and is never to be missed if you like simple comedy movies. It is an opportunity to laugh continuously for almost 2 hours, and never miss this opportunity." 
" Marriage for Schmucks","The Movie of Schmucks kicks off as a narration of a series of family incidents at a kids campfire, thus justifying the transition of episodes to a movie. A family of Naive Schmucks in today's world? Satish Shah's Introduction cameo (as a God visiting each house to distribute "Sweets of Intellect") in an engaging scene explains it all. "No one can face God, but even God cant face them" Agreed..Point Noted!Next, we have Hansa's (Supriya Pathak, "Over-the-Top" Schmuck) father dying(??) & hoping that his son Himanshu's (Producer J.D.Majethia, "Cook" Schmuck) wish be fulfilled. The Death Ceremony involves singing parodies of Bollywood chart busters & no remorse; it is here that the movie stands out, an unconventional death scene for a Hindi film, avoiding the usual set of associated emotions, that would have seemed out of place anyway. Bravo!The Schmucks set out to find a match for the "Cook" Schmuck which pretty much makes up the rest of the Movie. Eventually, the girl-next-door(Kirti Kulhari, "Adorable" Schmuck) falls for him, marriage is arranged but the movie cant finish so soon. Hero single, not ready to mingle?The pot-holed screen play(Director Aatish Kapadia) intentionally/ unintentionally manages to draw a subtle line between poking fun & pulling leg. The remorse-less death ceremony, the fact that Punjabis have no masculinity or femininity with respect to their names,legendary love stories incomplete without strife; they pulled the legs of the many mannerisms of society without hurting any sentiments. Gets on your nerves, maybe? But that's an achievement, indeed! Also, a Modern-Day story with a Moustached Lead Hero, side-characters seeking for trouble in a Love Story instead of uniting the Lovers makes for an unusual comic premise. The feat is pulled off with panache. Other Actors, Anang Desai("Sensible" Schmuck), sister-in-law Nimisha Vakharia("Leadership" Schmuck) & Rajeev Mehta("The REAL Schmuck") add to the spice of this brain-no-longer-in-your-knee story. Cinematography(Sanjay Jadhav) was vibrant & colorful. Editing(Hemal Kathari) & Background Score(Raju Singh) had hardly much of a job!Worth mentioning points here are the lyrics & placing of the song "Bhosale Market" which confirms the fact that the Movie is indeed pulling the leg of the conventional RomComs. The plot which carefully branches into subplots & side-incidents & jokes (PJs all the way!!) doesn't stray off too much(they brought in an overheated Farah Khan for what?) into satire or romance & as such ensures no break in its continuity. Khichdi defines its own genre between satire, romance, drama & slapstick comedy. By far, one of the few movies which kept the audiences in the halls up to the end of the credits(which were worth watching)The trailer doesn't promise High Expectations...It says "Khichdi, Now on the Big Screen".Now, I was never glued to TV sitcoms, so could I watch Khichdi? The answer is a loud "Yes"Hansa: Khichdi ?? What is...??Praful: Khichdi, Hansa....Kheech->PullKhich-Di -> Pulled itYeah, Khichdi team, you have pulled it off well!6 and +1 for "Bhosale Market" song & a different attempt at humourOverall 7 out of 10" 
" A Madcap laugh riot","Confession: I am not a fan of "Khichdi" TV series, but the movie certainly had me in splits. Mindless comedy, slapstick comedy, no brainers comedy - "Khichdi" has it all. It actually goes to set a benchmark how a no-brainer should be made. Are you listening who promote their stale comedy with "Leave your brains at home" (and money with us?). â® Supriya Pathak: A scene-stealer. Her performance and dialogue delivery is second to none. â® Anang Desai: Next to Supriya, he is the best.â® Rajeev Mehta:: Strong screen-presence to the extent the "Hansaaaa...." will be etched in your head.â® Himanshu Seth:: Not up to the mark. â® Kirti Kulhari:: Was a glorified miss-goody-two-shoes. â® Satish Shah:: Excellent portrayal, though I thought the entire segment was more of a stocking filler. â® Deven Bhojani: I wish he had more than the miss and blink appearance.Cameo by Farah Khan goes to show she loves the "Khichdi" TV series. Finally endorsed by Fox... way to go!!!The plot is wafer-thin but the gags and one-liners keep you on the roll. Certainly a good one-time watch..... and "Leave your brains at home...." ROFL!" 
" KHICHDI","Great Comedy Movie....Mind Blowing....Screenplay, Dialogue, Climax All Is Superb ....." 
" Not great as tv sitcom used to be..","This is not as great movie as used be tv sitcom.
Tv Sitcom wss just mind-blowing.
The only reason im giving this movie 5 stars is only Anang Desai,Supriya Phattak and Rajeev Mehta.
I missed legendary Jayshree (Vanda Phattak).
The movie has also many flaws.
As where are Raju and his two sisters? Where is badi baa???
The movie is can't take place greatness of Kichdi sitcom." 
" Spicy Khichdee That Makes You LOL.","How refreshing to see a Hindi movie based on an Indian TV-series. I'm not very familiar with Indian TV-series as most of the things I had witnessed on Indian channels were those abysmal soap-operas. Unfortunately, I had not seen the series on which this movie was based. But, after seeing 'Khichdi: The Movie', I wouldn't mind trying it out.I decided to see the film after catching the trailer. Aatish Kapadia does a fine writing job. Even though there are a few jokes that have been overdone in the past, there are plenty of original and clever ones that make you laugh out loud. The pacing sometimes slackens but it quickly picks up once you notice that it's going a little slow. The story pokes fun at several traditional Bollywood films that went on to become blockbusters but it's more of a homage than a mockery.But the highlight of 'Khichdi: The Movie' are the Parekhs. They are one of the funniest families I've seen in an Indian movie and they provide some excellent laugh-out-loud moments. Anang Desai, Rajeev Mehta, Nimisha Vakharia and especially Supriya Pathak and Jamnadas Majethia are a laugh riot. The supporting cast contribute well. Even Farah Khan makes a funny appearance as herself.It's good to see a refreshing Indian comedy film that could actually make you laugh out loud which has become quite rare in today's Hindi cinema. I would like to get a hold of the TV series." 
" Enjoyable only if you are a fan of its original T.V. Series.","Following the Western trend of making full length movies on Hit Television Series, Bollywood comes up with its own original film adapted from the famous comedy T.V. Serial KHICHDI. Based on the same theme, settings and characters, the film is quite similar to its original source and has nothing exceptional or extra-ordinary in store for its audience (especially the new ones).In clear words, KHICHDI can be liked or appreciated by only the die-hard fans of the T.V. Serial who are already well aware of all the family members in the story interacting with each other. But for anyone who is not previously familiar with the characters and their unique mannerisms it doesn't prove to be a thoroughly enjoyable comedy as a whole. Though the writer-director, Aatish Kapadia starts off well with a good self explanatory sequence depicting why all the characters on the screen are so dumb and weird (featuring Satish Shah as the GOD distributing Akal Ke Ladoo). But later on the film goes back to the same serial type of proceedings revolving around the topic of an inter-caste marriage between a Gujrati and a Punjabi family. Here, sadly the Punjabi family and its members are just added on to have some quick jokes on the community which doesn't work and also seem to be in pretty bad taste at times. Frankly speaking, there are still many big names in the Bollywood Industry who are just interested in using a SIKH character in their films for a comic touch and nothing else. And at the same time there are many intelligent film-makers too who boldly decide to make a sensible and appreciable film like "Rocket Singh" completely written around a SIKH character in the lead.Anyway, coming back to KHICHDI, it has two kinds of humor or comedy. One, which is normal and can be understood by everyone watching the movie in the theater. But the second is the humor which can only be enjoyed by the fans of its original T.V. serial as they only know the reasons why the characters are behaving in their particular peculiar ways on the screen. So, the movie may work for some and may not for many who haven't ever watched or followed the Hit Television Series on which it is actually based.However, for KHICHDI family's die-hard fans, the movie does have its own truly enjoyable moments coming at regular intervals. But it really could have been a universal laugh riot with a tighter screenplay and a better story plot. The second half insertion of a murder sequence is not impressive, whereas the court room drama in the climax is hilarious. In addition to this, the Bollywood Song Parodies being sung at a funeral, also come as an enjoyable surprise (though may be considered weird by many).Performance wise, the actors in their famous getups and characters have nothing more to offer than the usual, as seen in the serial. Still their comic timing and the unique dialogue delivery style is superb. Supriya Pathak takes the credit of the best performer in the family, brilliantly supported by all and both Farah Khan & Satish Shah remain truly entertaining in their guest appearances. Musically the film has nothing in its kitty but the Cinematography is fine with very colourful sets and backgrounds.On the whole, KHICHDI may entertain its true small screen fans, who have been watching the serial from years, but for the others it might not serve the purpose." 
" One of the most unique comedy films ever!","We as a family are huge fans of this film ever since we caught a few glimpses of it on the Indian film channel Star Gold. Everyone of us noted its name and arranged for us this film within days so that we could watch it from the beginningIt is the utter nonsense nature of the family's thoughts that makes it a once in a lifetime experience. I remember the first time we watched it none of us could get over the fact how someone can act as daal in a play (and the other two as a pateelah and the Taj Mahal)! It is a laugh riot of the highest order and I must commend whoever came up with such a unique idea of comedy, as apart from the aforementioned ones there were many other jokes that I could on about for hours (like "October tak parrhha hoo'n", the jaleybee scene, the bell/bull scene, the courtroom madness and many more!)Hansa, Himanshu and Praful should go down as amongst the funniest characters in the history of comedy films! I really hope that they make a some kind of sequel of it.Now, there's a thought of objecting to making fun of Sikhs as a community, and I would fully understand anyone who disliked it, but one thing I must commend the Sikhs for is that they tend to be thick-skinned and rarely take offence to jokes about them. It is their own non-reaction to such comedy and jokes that makes us take it our stride in the first place. Sure enough, if they begin to take offence to such stuff then people would think twice about making such a film and the viewers too would begin to feel uncomfortable. So kudos to the Sikh community for this!" 
" Khichdi- A Dose of Unlimited Thali","Khichdi- A Dose of Unlimited Thali is not just a dish made of rice and daal, but this Khichdi has all the M for Garam Masalas, T for Lemons and B for Fried Onions'- Tadka maad ke !!!!!You will not only be served with Khichdi but the full unlimited thali. And you will get:Ghee :as Witty lines are the USPs Baingan ka Bharta:Jayshree Enjoy Aaloo ka bharta (mashed potato with onions, green chili and salt):Hansa and crisp Papad : Tulsidas get along with Pickles too: Praful Then lick tomato chutney (blanched tomato, onion, green chili): Lady Parminder and finally Raita: Himanshu.The TV sitcom has come to silver screen, and a movie buff like me who never watches these sitcoms was all surprised. The laughter kept coming in small pockets from this super-characterization of Parekh families. The movie will not push you with the humor, but the consistent smile with the non consistent head shakes that will make you wonder about the silly and witty lines. The whole family is real stupid, down to the core. At least the khichdi is clean and hygienic, with no double meaning at all like our new generation of comedy. Yes the whole family can watch and enjoy this Gujju delicacy. This is an answer to The Simpsons and his family of idiots, You cannot find better idiots than them. The screenplay is not idiotic but smart and rule the movie. Real dumb and dumber and dumberer. The camera and direction is simple and no special mention is required. The forced songs are useless but again spoof, however the market song is better. All the actors are well justified and they are within the skin of their TV roles.2star for the screenplay and the courage of transforming small screen coms to silver screen."
