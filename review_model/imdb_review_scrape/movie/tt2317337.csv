" Donates Genuineness in Peculiar Small Films","Blood Donation is an old theme nowadays. Why not sperm? Fertilization has been shown previously in movies like I AM, The Tree Of Life and more. But Vicky Donor bring an aspect of Comedy involving fertilization in the movie. That's a different and peculiar attempt introduced in Bollywood movie. A fresh theme with fresh stars featured in a feature film - Vicky Donor.John Abraham, The new boy in Producer Town does an earnest effort here and deals with a fresh theme based on a totally out-of-the-box concept. John after acting on 'masala maardhaar' movies now starts investing money on offbeat movies - that's strange but is smart also as the promos of Vicky Donor has a youth appeal also keeping beside the sperm oriented theme. Some in the town thinks Vicky Donor is somehow sex-oriented and disgusting in theme as it deals with such vulgar things like sperm donation and fertilization. Anyhow still Vicky Donor makes its individual impact in Bollywood and its pretty good.In an environment where the job pressures are high and couples lead an erratic and unhealthy lifestyle, Dr. Baldev Chaddha (Annu Kapoor), a well-qualified fertility expert, runs a fertility clinic and a sperm bank in Daryaganj, New Delhi. Unfortunately, he has more failed cases to his credit than successes. A healthy, high-performing donor is the need of the hour.Vicky Arora (Ayushymann Khurrana), a young, good looking Punjabi guy from Lajpat Nagar, is the only son and of no financial support to his mother Dolly (Dolly Ahluwalia), a widow, who runs a small beauty parlor from home. As luck would have it, a small brawl in the colony brings Dr. Chaddha and Vicky face to face, where Chaddha concludes that Vicky could be that donor he has been looking for. From here on, Dr. Chaddha's days and nights are spent in convincing Vicky to become a donor till he finally gives in.Vicky finds his love interest in Ashima Roy (Yami Gautam), a pretty Bengali girl, who works in a bank. But soon their hunky dory world comes crashing down because of Vicky's past as a donor.Vicky Donor is a special mixture of Youth, Romance, Sperm Donation type offbeat concept and Comedy. So, compilation like this is hard to find in recent movies and there's where VD wins the race for its individuality. Even being a small budget film, VD gives you the feel of the same amount of humor, romance and consciousness about the concept used in a big budget film. It enlightens, then entertains and then wins.Shoojit Sircar, after giving such a serious movie like YAHAAN (2005), it was very unlike to see a comic movie from him after 7 years. Anyway he deals very well with Vicky Donor and gives justice to the concept. Story, Dialogue and Script by Juhi Chaturvedi was very neat, sophisticated and came to a very good conclusion as the two parts of the movie was capably balance. Cinematography was not such a big deal for the movie but still good work done by Kamaljeet Negi. Editing by Shekhar Prajapati was good. The soundtrack of the movie is mediocre but still tracks like PANI DA RANG (sung, written and composed by the lead actor of the movie Ayushmann Khurrana), MAR JAIYAAN & RUM WHISKY work perfectly. These three songs are worth listen for many times. Background scores also by the music director duo Abhishek-Akshay duo are perfect for the movie.Shoojit Sircar, I must say has chosen the actors for the movie very aptly. The very famous face from the Television Ayushmann Khurrana is good-looking, humorous and a very good performer. The naturalism in his expression and act was fascinating and profound. Another fresh face from Television Yami Gautam was strikingly beautiful, sensible and a good performer. Her presence and charm in various sequences adds value to them. Annu Kapoor aka Dr. Chadda is an anomaly. His humorous acts, sensitive acting adds the movie a new aspect.Dolly Ahluwalia (Vicky's Mom) was very well as well as Kamlesh Gill (Vicky's grand-mom). Jayanta Das (Ashima's father) was fine. John Abraham makes a stunning impact on viewers by appearing in the song "RUM & WHISKY".Finally, Vicky Donor is just like sperms, tiny but very effective and gives birth to a new idea in entertainment. With genuineness in script and rigorous performances by leading actors, Vicky Donor is successful in making a strong ascendancy in small budget films. Try not to miss this one." 
" The most pleasant surprise of the year... a really witty, feel-good joyride!",""The best things in life come in small packages.." This adage came to my mind when I stepped out after watching 'Vicky Donor'.. Easily the best socially relevant comedy made in recent times, this one needs to be appreciated for its natural wit & intelligence in dealing with a sensitive issue in a non-preachy way. The movie manages to entertain as well as enlighten, & thats' a rare feat in context of Hindi Cinema. The movie succeeds in driving home its point in a subtle manner. Newcomer "Ayush-Man" is a complete natural in his roguishly charming Delhi guy act, while fellow débutante Yaami Gautam has extremely likable screen presence & is a competent performer as well. As a pair, both of them have a great on-screen chemistry, & their romantic track blends well with the story. On the other hand, every member of the supporting cast is an absolute delight to watch, especially Anu Kapoor as "Doctor Fertility". The music is also quite good, with "Paani Da Rang..." being the best pick with its soothing composition. There is some emotional drama in the 2nd half & the culmination is arguably convenient, yet it suits the "feel-good" tone of the film. Overall, this is a crisply entertaining movie with a BIG heart. Highly recommended for lovers of good cinema, & a welcome break from all the crude slapstick "comedies" that are regularly dished out at the Indian Box Office in the name of entertainment. A complete surprise package!" 
" Vicky Donor (U/A)--------------------Rating: 5/5","wow...fantastic movie with the heavy n strong concept...... the movie contains about raw usage of script and more comedy with beautiful songs.... A must watch film.... Very difficult to find but some conservatives might not like the concept...A man is brought in by an infertility doctor to supply him with his sperm, where he becomes the biggest sperm donor for his clinic. Vicky Donor is a light hearted comedy that takes a look at the taboo attached to infertility and artificial insemination.The Story .. of courseDr Baldev Chaddha (Annu Kapoor), a well qualified fertility expert, runs a fertility clinic and a sperm bank in Dariyaganj, New Delhi, that guarantees a high quality and specialized sperm for the purpose.

With a brief emotional roller coaster ride, Vicky Donor is a light-hearted take on the subject of sperm donation.What to look out forSparkled with exceptional performance by Annu Kapoor as Dr. Chadda and the wonderful debut by Ayushmann Khurrana as Vicky Arora.. Vicky Donor is a fertile entertainer with focus to tell an endearing love story centered round sperm donation glory..John Abraham deserves a special pat for not following bollywood trends as a producer and opting for a out of the box subject on sperm donations for his debut as producer and not using his stardom and making way for a newcomer for a wonderful debut.. highly remarkable..Shoojit Sircar grows immensely as a story teller and shows vast improvement from Yahan (2005) to Vicky Donor. With the all round support of his writer Juhi Chaturvedi he captures the mood of Delhi in light, funny and tangy first half then giving us those genuinely stirring moments rather late in the game and ending up with a sweet note.All this wouldn't have been possible without the active support of Yami Gautam who makes a beautiful debut.. Watching her is treat to your eye and the girl delivers a sparkling performance.Dolly Ahluwalia is excellent as mom and Kamlesh Gill as the grand ma is outstanding.. Whenever she appears on screen she eats up other actor's presence. Jayanta Das as Yami's father is adequate.Music and dialogues are in sync with the film. Pani da song is the pick of the lot.. editing is sharp and other technicalities are fine. Production values are up to markWhat NotVery difficult to find but some conservatives might not like the conceptConclusion: Vicky Donor is avant grade cinema that is fertile at the Box Office. Those who complain Bollywood for running out of ideas.. 'Vicky Donor donates sperms of hope.. a must watch.." 
" 7.5/10 - Delightfully deft!","The chief concerns of a 25 year old? Money, a job, a girlfriend and some respect from his family. Vicky Donor injects a new age career (if you may call it) of donating sperms in to the life of a happy, cricket loving, 25 but jobless Delhi boy Vicky (Ayushmann Khurrana). After Dr. Baldev Chaddha, (Annu Kapoor) an infertility specialist overtly chases Vicky for this covert job; he begins to enjoy the perks that come along with the job. However with great perks come great pains. Great perks – money, job, girlfriend (incidental to the job) and respect from his family. Great Pains – Not being able to tell his family and girlfriend about his career. So do the perks outweigh the pains? Or life is beyond such naive comparisons? For the answers, watch the movie!While you are at it, you will be treated to some delightful real life characters, Kamlesh Gill as Vicky's alcohol-loving, forward-thinking grandma, Dolly Ahluwalia as Vicky's alcohol-loving, loud and dutiful mother, Annu Kapoor the singularly focused Dr. Baldev Chaddha, the beautiful Ashima Roy (Yami Gautam) and her oh-so Bengali family. The banter between Kamlesh Gill and Dolly Ahluwalia, Annu Kapoor's character who sees life through the lens of sperms will keep you chuckling through the movie. You will want to cheer the celebration of differences and the eventual mingling between the Punjabis and the Bengalis, brought to the fore in the wedding sequence.Is this Ayushmaan's debut? Wow! Doesn't seem like that! He comes across as completely natural and never seems anything besides Vicky! He is absolutely lovable as the boy next door. Annu Kapoor is scintillating. He amuses you and makes you laugh. Kamlesh Gill and Dolly Ahluwalia are uncontainable. Debutant Yami Gautam looks delectable and performs well. Juhi Chaturvedi's very believable story has a thoroughly enjoyable screenplay where witty one-liners are the order of the day. Kamaljit Negi's cinematography is good. Shekhar Prajapati's snips ensure the movie never slows down. Abhishek-Akshay's music carries the narration forward while Rum Whiskey will be a party smasher!Director Shoojit Sircar after a hiatus of 7 years (Yahaan 2005) deftly blends in a topical story with some endearing characters and real life sequences to dish out a delightful slice of life film!

" A great quality 'sperrrm'...errr.... movie!!!","Some trailers makes me want to go to the theaters the first day; some trailers, I don't want to watch even the trailer completely. With VD, I was not sure. So I went anyways. Thank God I did. From the first scene to the last, it was worth it.A great script dealing with masturbation indirectly yet without any vulgarity in words or scenes. It will easily pass off as a 'modern' family entertainer. It is not easy to bring out the film in such a great script and kudos to the director and editors for sending out a altogether new message and getting it out from the actors. All the actors were spot on. But a special mention to the mom and her in-law, and their on screen chemistry. The leads have also done well, but Annu kapoor is the class act. Then final scene in which he breaks- down laughing, makes him in the list of my great actors in India. No unnecessary songs,long shots, close-ups, drama etc,. it was all just about perfect. There were some pit falls on the acting in some scenes of Anshuman and Yaani, but come'on the made up for it later. All together a great movie, coming in the times of Kahaani, Paan Singh Tomar etc,. only shows that this might be India's turn to its greatest star ever- The Script.Rush and watch!!!" 
" Donate Some Time To Vicky Donor - Worth It :)","Very Recently I had an argument with a friend when i asked him that out of the two movies released this Friday which would be given preference bu him. He said and I'd quote that "(It's a)disgrace that people can actually watch this".No offence but Vicky Donor would be like a slap on the face for such people. It is fresh, entertaining and thoroughly enjoyable.Starring Ayushmann Khurrana as the Punjabi munda Vicky who doesn't have a job of his own and is constantly nagged by his mother played by Dolly Alluwalia. His grandma, on the other hand as Vicky himself says pretty modern and very supportive. All's not well for him until Dr.Baldev Chadda played by Annu Kapoor finds out that Vicky can be an excellent sperm donor. Midway he falls in love with Ashima Roy(Yami Gautam) and the story carries on further.The interesting part about Vicky Donor is that although the film preaches the topic of sperm donation at no point does the film uses vulgarity or cheap humour to carry it along. The music is very catchy at the least and songs like 'Paani da' and 'Rum whisky' really help to keep up the tempo of the movie.The screenplay by Juhi Chaturvedi is apt and even the 2 hr 15 min doesn't seem too long.Yes the dialogues are a bit repetitive, the story a bit sluggish in parts but the good acting performances by the entire cast hide the negatives more or less. Annu Kapoor, Dolly and her mother-in-law impress in particular. Ayushmann has very good screen presence and Yami looks superb.It's a definite thumbs up from my side for Shoojit Sircar's Vicky Donor. You should not give this a miss if possible.3/5" 
" Perfect Entertainer....Light Comedy with Heavy Topic","It turned out to be pleasant surprize form Vicky Donor. While I waited for one week for the reviews before confirming if the movie is watchable, the movie stood tall in all aspects. Anu Kapoor is back with a bang with some impressive performances by Ayushman and Yami. The movie provided the right perspective to look at sperm donation and its importance. Though the conservatives with frown at such issues, even from the entertainment point of view, the movie provides everything that audience expects from a movie. The punches are spot on in terms of timing as well as dialogs. While a majority of the dialogs are in Punjabi (which might repel certain set of audiences), it just improves the originality of the plot. Music has been another highlight of the movie with the song "Paani Da Rang" being the masterpiece. Overall, a good 2-3 times watch." 
" A refreshing surprise!","To people who would like to believe that this movie is vulgar, I would suggest, go along with your kids! It's a refreshing surprise from director Sircar, and is 2 hours 15 minutes of pure fun. Anu Kapoor stands out for his once in a lifetime portrayal of an infertility specialist. His props, clinic and the hand gesture (just loved it) are just amazing! I am forced to wonder why is he not more visible on screen! Ayushman is a complete natural as a punjabi boy. Not for one moment would you even feel this is his debut in bollywood. Yami Gautam is gorgeous and appears very soothing to the eye. The modern grandmother and mum have been excellently portrayed by the respective actors. This is perhaps first time in bollywood that you have a saas-bahu and daaru scene! Two characters that really stand out throughout the movie are undoubtedly Dr Chaddhha and the grandmother! A must watch for everyone" 
" Vicky Donor: Better than I expected","I don't like Bollywood cinema, it has just never appealed to me and therefore I tend to avoid such movies like anything with Tom Cruise.I found myself watching Vicky Donor as it's supposed to be an Indian remake of the excellent French Canadian movie Starbuck (2011). I'll say right off the bat, it's not............it really really isn't and they need to stop making that claim.A very high rated Indian movie it tells the story of a lovable loser type who reluctantly begins donating sperm. He hides it from his family and the woman he loves because for some reason it would bring great shame.That's it, so again this is not Starbucks plot at all despite being advertised as such.It has most of the Bollywood tropes but thankfully no sudden dance numbers, I really couldn't have sat through it if there had been. There is however a heavy soundtrack and in this guys view it damaged the film.The soundtrack grinds, the characters certainly could have been more likeable and much of the film feels like a melodrama more than anything else.However on the flipside some of the writing is excellent, the plot though simple is handled well and the finale really saved the movie.Vicky Donor is not Starbuck but it has it's own identity and for a guy who hates Bollywood I can't deny that it certainly has its moments.Vicky Donor is an enjoyable affair despite its flaws.The Good:Yami GautamSome of the script is exceptionalGreat finaleThe Bad:Randomly shifting back and forth between languages mid conversationFrustrating soundtrackNot even remotely the Starbuck storyJokes tend to miss their markThings I Learnt From This Movie:When a movie starts with the fact it was created by the "Eros" network it makes a person pause and recheck they have the right film!Indians talk so fast it can make subtitles a chore at timesIf "God" wanted you to have a child surely you wouldn't be infertileShaking hands with someone after they've made a sperm donation seems like a bad callThe word "Coming" was used a suspicious amount in this film, intentional?!Banks allow their employees to go in after hours to mope dramaticallyA person who refers to everyone as sperm would likely not be on my speed dial" 
" finally a good 2012 bollywood movie ...!!!!","VICKY DONOR - firstly i liked the title very much and trailers also sounded good.the movie truly satisfied the trailers which normally don't occur in case of most of the bollywood movies.The trailers are made good but when we see the movie the only dialogue we say - what the f**k is this ? now about vicky donor - its a good comedy movie.lots of dialogues are in punjabi and are so hilarious.the punches are so good.AYUSMANN KHURANA gave a thrilling performance.didn't seem like his first movie and the actress YAMI GAUTAM was also fab.overall the movie is superb. MUSTTTTTT WATCH GUYS..........!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!" 
" Vicky Donor - Best Sperm ji ;)","Vicky Donor a light hearted movie deals with a taboo subject of Sperm Donation. Movie kicks off with an infertility clinic in Daryaganj , Delhi being run by Mr. Baldev Chaddha(Enacted by Anu kapoor), who has a client list of mostly failed cases! He is in search for a sperm donor & he gets the same as Vicky Arora (enacted by Ayushmaan Khuranna).Vicky is a boy from middle class family residing in Lajpat Nagar. He is job less & super lazy! He is a lively character though, full of life, always happy, loves shopping & playing cricket. His mother is widow & runs Dolly boutique at her home only & home runs on her earning only. SPECIALLY FOR THE PUNJABIS THERE ARE SPECIFIC MOMENTS YOU WOULD SURELY LOVE LIKE VICKY'S MOM & GRANDMA DRINKING WHISKY & TALKING IN PUNJABI! Good hearted comedy! And to add to the charm was Ashima Roy - Bong babe! ( Enacted by Yamini Gautam), she completely wins you over with her beauty & charm!Vicky donor is basically a story of how a guy gets into sperm donation bcos of an irritating & glued Mr.Chadha, then continues it because of greed of money & takes it up as social service, then he fells in love with Ashima, a banker who is divorcée & soon after getting nods of their families both tie up the knot, but soon they discover they cant be parents & Ashima gets to know Vicky was a sperm donor & how their relation goes through the highs & lows of life & how they eventually get back together & Ashima accepts him the way he is bcos he donated to make other families happy! Let the review be this much or i might end up spilling the whole story! Go for it worth a watch! If i vote for it as a Punjabi then 8.5/10 For a normal viewer - 8/10.Don't expect anything go with a light mood & you would come out smiling! All characters have been very well enacted by respective stars! STAR FACTOR- JOhn Abraham in Rum whisky! Smokin he is! ;)" 
" A nice movie!","With the passage of time audience have seen that the cinema has changed. I would call it a 360 degree change. There were times when action flicks used to be the talk of the town. There used to be an angry young man beating up the goons either for the sake of vengeance or for proving his macho character. Then there were times when love stories were liked by budding lovers and college sweet-hearts, those movies used to have some great music compositions which were instantly liked and loved by the listeners (of that time). Now weird (for some people) and interesting (for other viewers) movies are made. At some circles slapstick comedies are encouraged and on the other hand people are also appreciating thought provoking cinema. This particular movie, "Vicky Donor" is a combination of both.The movie might not get success, on the basis of its topic, screenplay and concept, if it would have been released in 90's or even in 2000's. Audience is much more ready to accept things nowadays. The movie is tale of a Punjabi boy named Vicky Arora (Ayushman) whose great grandfather had 19 children. This story also revolves around a (not so successful) middle aged Doctor Baldev Chadda (Annu Kapoor) who specializes in infertility operations and he runs a fertility clinic and looking for a sperm donor. Last but not the least, this movie also revolves around the love of a Punjabi guy with a Bengali girl Ashima Roy (Yaami Gautam) and their trust and understanding.The theme of the movie is really interesting yet controversial, for some. Dr. Chadda convinces Vicky to donate his sperm so that he can give happiness to those parents who are not blessed with their biological kids. For this he quotes some factual yet hilarious examples to Vicky, regarding Mahabhaarat's time. Finally Dr. Chadda convinces Vicky and he starts to donate sperms. The sequence between Annu Kapoor (as Dr. Chadda) and Ayushmaan (as Vicky) are amazingly hilarious and here definitely Annu Kapoor being a veteran actor takes the audience to the heights of laughter. It is not easy to share the screen with Annu Kapoor but Ayushmaan makes his presence noticed strongly. They both complement each other in almost every scene be it be dramatic or funny. Those who know the roles portrayed by Annu Kapoor in his career will never doubt that he has a caliber that is not shared by many actors. Be it his "Gali Gali Chor hai" or "7 Khoon Maaf" both roles portrays huge contrast. For those who really want to see his amazing performance must watch "Ek Ruka hua faisla" (21 years old young Annu Kapoor portraying a 59 years old lawyer).On the other hand (débutant) Ayushman is also full of surprises. He performs extremely nice as a funky, easy going and smart ass boy at one place, whereas he astonishes audience in climax (I don't want to spoil the experience – watch it yourself). Be it a serious thing or comical the young talent has the potential to get noticed. Yaami Gautam is a well known name of Indian TV Channels but she debuts in this movie and guys will love her charms and sweetness. She does not portray an "Oh So Sexy" role but even then am sure guys will smile after watching her and noticing her simplicity. She can go a long way provided she chooses right roles.There are other characters that shine in this movie, including, Vicky's mom (Dolly Ahluwalia) and grand mom (Kamlesh Gill). Jayanta Das, portraying the father of Yaami Gautam, excels brilliantly.On the whole, John Abraham has managed to produce a great piece of funny and witty cinema. The movie shares a nice plot line, if we can save a dying man by donating our blood, why can't we grant our sperms to grant a whole life to someone who does not even exists in the world. The good things about this movie are that it has freshness, good humor, some great performances and a nice handling. Only drawback – it lacks star power (which these days is a must for many movie goers).Music is average, dialogues are hilarious and direction is promising." 
" Why 8 or 9 out of 10????!!!!!","As I am writing this, about 5000 people have rated this film; 25% of them have rated it a 10. 50% of them have rated it a 9 or 8 and the remaining 25% have rated it a 7 or less. I am not going to even bother with the bottom 25% - they exist to make life interesting and adventurous. The top 25%: glad you got it. The remaining 50% who rated it 8 or 9 - I ask you this humbly and earnestly: Why? Lets look at the film as objectively as in my opinion, I can. The script of the film is excellent; no major glitches, hardly any minor ones, respect for the audience's intelligence, very authentic (if you happen to be familiar with the Delhi milieu, you will surely agree), multi-dimensional characters, 3 complete acts, extremely good dialogues. Technically, as in cinematography, production design, art direction, sound, sfx, it has limited scope due to the script, but within that limited scope, very competent. The editing could perhaps have chopped off about 1-2 minutes in the pre-climax when there is a conflict in the protagonists' lives. The music is very apt for the tone and flow of the film, Paani Da Rang being my personal favourite. Very ably directed by Soojit Sircar. He had a fantastic script to work with and his genius was in adhering to it. He has also done a brilliant job in his choice of actors. Ayushman Khurana, Anu Kapoor, Yami Gautam and Dolly Ahluwalia are the principal characters who have all done a fabulous job. But the diligence of Sircar lies in his choice of his supporting cast. There are at least another 20 speaking characters in the film and their competent characterization in writing and performing lends tremendous credibility to the film. From a financial standpoint, the film was made on a very reasonable budget (Rs. 5 crore as per wikipedia) and marketed appropriately earning over 9 times the cost (again as per wikipedia). So the producers have done justice to their investors as well as distributors. Great balance of art and commerce.Now, moving on to the heart from the brain, this film in my opinion is phenomenal. It is a great comedy not just for its laugh-off-your-chair moments, but for its numerous bring-a-smile-to-your-face moments and touch-your-heart moments. In the world of films, most of us love categorization as per genres and this would fall into the feel-good comedies section at your DVD store or your online streaming website. And we are unfortunately programmed to think that feel-good is not worthy of a 10. There should be some larger-than-life greatness or a very grand idea about how to make the world a better place for a movie to be rated a 10. I will just say this: (aside from the fact that as a healthy father married to the healthy mother of our healthy 8 month old grace from God baby girl, I balled my eyes out at the end of this 2 hour joyful bliss) Hrishikesh Mukherjee would have been very proud of Shoojit Sircar. Definitely the best of 2012 thus far." 
" A good low budget movie..","Vicky Arora (Ayushmann Khurana) is an aimless and jobless Delhi boy. He is persuaded by Dr Baldev Chaddha (Annu Kapoor), an infertility clinic owner to become a sperm donor that could help childless couples. After much resistance, he finally agrees to the act to earn some easy money. Soon he makes a fortune out of his potent attribute. He also marries the love of his life Ashima (Yaami Gautam) but things take a drastic turn when she comes to know about his covert contributions to the sperm bank.Vicky Donor comes with a fresh story. Call it a love story on the backdrop of sperm donation or a film about sperm donation with a love story within - the writing by Juhi Chaturvedi seamlessly integrates the two elements to come up with a wholesome entertainer. Further director Shoojit Sircar flawlessly catches the pulse of Delhi and the drama in the narrative.While the film lightly touches on the theme of the shortage of sperm donors and the social stigma attached to the act (unlike blood or organ donations), it intentionally refrains from being an issue-based cinema. Vicky's initial opposition to the idea aptly brings out the average apprehensions and his consequent consent reveals the monetary motives behind the act.The love story between the lead pair that starts off on a flirtatious note but soon translates into an amiable affair, brings a sublime smile on your face throughout. The romance is refreshing and the chemistry between the couple is hot-n-happening. Soon the love affair of the cross-cultural couple gets into the 'Two States' zone. The film takes an unapologetic look at the culture characteristics (or call it clichés) of the Punjabi boy and Bengali girl and the divergent divide expressed in the sequence of scenes that lead to their matrimony is absolutely uproarious.But beyond having a splendid sense of humour, the film also has a very poignant side to it. The fact that Vicky's fervent fertility isn't of any productive use to himself is where the film defines a strong contrasting conflict in the narrative. Since the couple's camaraderie was so sizzling, you feel the pinch as they part ways. Further Sircar successfully defines and distinguishes emotions, elucidating how the point of marital discord between the couple is not merely mistrust but insecurity. The climax comes across as convenient though isn't unconvincing.The pacing is fast and the multiple-montage crisp editing never lets you lose the narrative. The dialogues vary from the quirky to the well- worded conversations and contribute immensely to the humour quotient. The music is peppy and goes smoothly with the flow of the film.Vicky Donor is what it is primarily for the livewire energy of Vicky played by Ayushmann Khurana. The actor is so natural that it never seems he's acting but rather gliding through the role. He is a pro at both the comedy and emotional scenes. Given the right roles, Ayushmann has the potential to be the next big thing in Bollywood. Yaami Gautam is absolutely ravishing and captivates with her unending charm. The beauty also reflects in her performance. The supporting cast is blessed with quirky yet relatable characterizations. Annu Kapoor as the desperate doctor is brilliant and incites most laughs. Dolly Ahluwalia as the hyperactive Punjabi mother is superlative and such a pleasant change from the regular prototypes. Kamlesh Gill as the modern grandma who shares a drink with her daughter-in-law and aspires for iphones and LED TVs is another fabulous characterization and a fantabulous actor. Jayanta Das as the girl's Bengali father is as much amusing." 
" A good entertaining film","Dr Baldev Chaddha (Annu Kapoor), a well qualified fertility expert, runs a fertility clinic and a sperm bank in Dariyaganj, New Delhi, that guarantees a high quality and specialized sperm for the purpose. Unfortunately he has more failed cases to his credit than successes. A healthy, high performing donor is the need of the hour. Vicky Arora (Ayushmann Khurrana), a young, good-looking, Punjabi boy from Lajpat Nagar, is the only son and of no financial support to Dolly, a widow, who runs a small beauty parlor from home.As luck would have it, a small brawl in the colony brings Dr Chaddha and Vicky, face to face, where Chaddha, concludes that Vicky could be THAT donor he has been looking for. From here on, Chaddha's days and nights are spent in convincing Vicky to become a donor till he finally gives in. Vicky finds his love interest in Ashima Roy (Yami Gautam)-a divorcée who is afraid to retail her heart, again and a pretty Bengali girl, who works in a Bank. But soon their hunky dory world comes crashing down because of Vicky's past as a donor. With a brief emotional roller coaster ride, Vicky Donor is a light-hearted take on the subject of sperm donation.I saw this movie yesterday and i think that Vicky Donor is a good entertaining film.It is a one time watch movie. Just see and enjoy." 
" Its not only a fine comedy but one of the best romantic movies from Bollywood with a loving message.","First of all I would like to congratulate John Abraham to back & produce a film on such an off-track subject which is usually not supported by the producer community. I have always believed that after becoming hugely successful in your own field, it's the duty of a person to support some good & meaningful projects which otherwise don't get any approval from the fearful Industry. And with VICKY DONOR, John fulfills his duty in an impressive manner, without featuring in it in the lead role and giving a much deserving chance to the talented cast.Secondly (as said earlier in a review), the film once again proves that 'An Enjoyable, Must See Movie' solely depends upon Writing, Writing & Writing alone. So the next set of wishes goes to both the director Shoojit Sircar and the screenplay-dialogue writer Juhi Chaturvedi for making a thoroughly enjoyable film offering many hilarious and thoughtful sequences with many well written lines right till the end. They both not only convert a serious subject of artificial insemination into an entertaining comic one but at the same time also retain the optimistic feel of the issue in a splendid manner. Moreover they also meet another requisite of Good Cinema in which movies should both entertain and enlighten the viewers about some rare issues of the society. And VICKY DONOR being a comic take will surely enlighten many more viewers of the country about this available medical technique, who might not be aware of it till now with a clear vision.Third are the fabulous performances in the movie from its entire talented start cast interacting beautifully. Actually the magic behind their great acts lies in the notable characterizations of their respective roles written realistically by Juhi. Ayushmann will surprise many in the industry with his completely natural, confident and captivating performance in the lead role of a sperm donor. And he really bowled me over with the way he speaks Punjabi in the film in a flawless style. Frankly there has to be someone behind that undoubtedly.Annu Kapoor once again proves the exceptional talent he has in his outstanding portrayal of an Artificial Insemination Specialist Doctor operating from a small office in Daryaganj. His act readily proves that he is unarguably one of the most under-rated & under-utilised veteran actors of Bollywood till date. Yami Gautam acts well and looks stunning on the screen as never before. In fact after a long time I felt like witnessing a character on the screen with whom the viewer can easily fall in love instantly. She adds both glamour as well as sensitivity to the project impressively and this is sure going to fetch her many more reputed projects soon.Jayanta Das as Yami's father and the actress playing her aunt suit their roles perfectly. But one of the major appealing points of the film remain Dolly Ahluwalia and Kamlesh Gill who play Ayushmann's mother and grandmother respectively. The two ladies are truly the scene-stealers here with their funky dialogues and great face expressions. Especially when they both are talking about their past experiences in a drunkard state and while dancing in the marriage sequences. The viewers are positively going to talk about them first while walking out of the hall before any other actor.Musically VICKY DONOR gets ample support from two fine tracks played repeatedly in the film namely, "Rum Whiskey" and "Pani Da Rang". John makes a friendly experience in "Rum Whiskey" played in the end credits and "Pani Da Rang" gels well with the story progression on the screen which is composed, written and sung by the lead hero Ayushmaan himself. The background score supports the comic feel of the film perfectly and cinematography is fine capturing the Delhi ambiance in a realistic mode once again.Besides, taking a clue from its promotional campaign on various channels, VICKY DONOR might appear to you as a rare comedy made on an off-beat sexual subject. But clearing this misconception I would like to reveal that along with being a hilarious take on the serious subject in its first half, VD is a great romantic film with heartfelt emotions in its later part. In true words, I would like to rate it amongst the best romantic films made in Bollywood which not only talks about an inter- caste marriage between a Punjabi & Bengali but which also revolves around a thoughtful subject of artificial insemination written brilliantly with some great comic touches and a fantastic climax.VICKY DONOR also goes into the list of those well made successful movies which take huge support from Punjabi language and Delhi's famous Punjabi Mohalla vibes for its entertaining script. Though frankly I don't support the way the makers show the Punjabi ladies abusing and drinking heavily as if that's a part of their daily routine. But still taking the reference on a lighter note, I would strongly like to recommend VICKY DONOR to all my readers here who wish to see something fresh coming from our own loving Bollywood. Especially the friends coming from Bengali and Punjabi origin, as they would all surely enjoy watching this thoughtful realistic comedy more than anybody else.Ending with a strange question, which was also pointed out in a scene in the film, I would like to ask that if all the Palmists (the palm-lines readers) can tell how many children one has by looking at the lines on the palm, then how will they come to know about the children of a Sperm Donor whose sperm has been used by so many families?"
