" Finally an in-depth rendition.","Most attempts at this story focus on fighting and "chamatkaars", but this one truly captures, not just from a scriptural and spiritual perspective, but from a theatrical perspective the true nature of each of the characters that it introduces.The struggles and joys of having a relationship with Krishna are explored at a depth that is worthy of the Mariana's Trench that is this story." 
" Worth watching and will bring you to childhood.","I am keep watching countless with my 2 year old Son, he knows each and every part of film and starting his acting before playing on screen.It bought my childhood and keep alive of Character of Shree Krishna which inherited since long.Music and Songs are so live that overriding older traditional songs of Kali Nag and all others....Industry should focus on this type of movie more so that it spread little awareness of God and will brings positive energy in your child.Industry should also try to reform Geeta Bodh with small Cartoon Characters which will help small kids.A similar type of attempt should be made for Hanuman and Ram-Sita.Thanks" 
" Not only an entertainer for your children, Krishna Aur Kans will keep you glued to your seat as you will definitely recall the bygone days of your childhood!","It will not be true to say that I was not excited about the prospect of watching a 3D animated movie with a tub of popcorn in my hand. Like any other tween, I was literally jumping with excitement as I sat to watch the movie. And honestly, the movie lived up to my expectation. Krishna Aur Kans will definitely make you relive your childhood memories. Directed by Vikram Veturi, this two hours animated movie seems like a remake of Sri Krishna by Ramanand Sagar. Krishna Aur Kans starts with the holy city of Mathura being ravaged and destroyed by King Kans. His ruthless ways, cruelty, wickedness, and the fact the he thinks he is superior to the others helps him to destroy the beautiful and holy city and transform it into a miserable and sad place. A divine voice warns him that he will be challenged, defeated and killed by his sister Devaki and his brother-in-law's (Vasudev) eighth son. Krishna is born as the eighth son of the couple.Well, what happened next was quite predictable thanks to the heavy dose of mythological tales, serials and movies that we, as Indians, get to see as we grow up. Kans holds Devaki and Vasudev in a dungeon and one by one, kills the first seven sons borne by the couple. After the birth of Krishna, Vasudev secretly takes the baby all the way to Gokul after crossing the river Yamuna on a stormy night.Kans somehow manages to learn about this escape and sends the evil witch Putna to kill baby Krishna by breast feeding the baby with poisoned milk. But he fails in his attempt as Putna was killed by baby Krishna. Determined to get rid of his nemesis, Kans sends Bakasur, a cruel wicked bird with some attributes of a vulture to kill the baby. But he too fails making Kans more and more desperate and frightened. All this is already known to us as most of us have already watched the television series. However, viewing the same in 3D with a group of kids, most of whom are unaware of the turn of events, is an entirely different and exciting experience. The movie end on lines similar to the TV series when Krishna comes face- to-face with Kans. He defeats and kills Kans, frees his parents from the dungeon, reinstates Vasudev as the King of Mathura and ends the evil and tyrannical reign of the wicked king Kans. The animation is effortless yet a visual delight. The many scenes where Kans is shown venting his anger are sure to give anyone goose bumps. Some other scenes in the movie where we see Krishna in his playful mood and portions where he is seen thieving butter from the village ladies (Gopis) are a delight to watch.The voice-overs in the movie are perfect. Om Puri, who gives voice to the character of Kans, was excellent. One can easily say that no one could have done better. The evil laugh and the harsh baritone make the cartoon character alive. Yashoda's sweet voice was rendered by Juhi Chawla. I feel that Manoj Vajpayee, who gives voice to the character of Nand, was a tad under-used. There is also very little mention of the growing love-affair between Krishna and Radha, though in some scenes we see Radha swinging happily to the tune of the flute played by Krishna. The songs in the movie may seem a bit too much especially for the kids, but they are sweet and hummable. Overall, the movie might be a bit lengthy keeping in mind the fact that it was made entirely for kids. However, I will not suggest missing this movie. A visual delight and great entertainment, Krishna Aur Kans is a must-see." 
" Well, that dropped","The last time I checked out this movie it had like a 7.7 on this website! I feel kind of bad seeing as how I probably only loved it because so many other people did at the time. Yeah, I'm kind of a conformist and want to look at what's the highest rated. With all being said, I believe now that my completely unbiased opinion of this film is that it is good, just not great. It is hard for me to truly judge it, as I am not that familiar with Hindu mythology. I've seen other movies based on it, but as it's so massive it doesn't focus on the same story.I really was impressed by the animation this movie. I guess India hasn't made the transition from 2D to CGI unlike most Western countries. In fact, I think Eastern countries in general haven't done that. This movie tells the story of how Vishnu was born as a human and fought the evil Prince Rans while he was still a mere child. Anyway, I had no idea there was a demon in Hinduism that had poisonous milk in her breasts. Yeah, pretty creepy, but it's an original concept at least. Its main fault is that it is too long but Indian films usually are. The movements were good and it's always nice to learn about a culture that I am unfamiliar with. ***"
