" Bhaago","Vimal Kumar made some successful socials like JAISI KARNI WAISI BHARNI in 80's and off recent made craps like SSUKH and RAJAJI with his brother GovindaThis is one of his films which instead of Govinda Aftab didThe movie is so bad that you cringe Actually the film may have worked in 80's but in 2004 a complete disaster The scenes between Asrani and Kader Khan are outdated while Aftab- Kader scenes aren't striking either Gulshan Grover scenes are even worst and they also have a dual role of Kader Khan waiting for you which gets to your nerves and the entire climax is truly stupid The film was actually in making since 2001 and hence looks even more outdatedVimal Kumar's direction is non existent Music is outdatedAftab fails to act in this role, Surely not his cup of tea Though he excels in comedy, this role is too much for him Amisha doesn't get even much lines Kader Khan is as usual and so are Asrani, Gulshan Shakti Kapoor irritates" 
" funny movie","It is an out and out comedy movie. it is outdated but i still enjoyed watching this film. Asrani is so funny in this. His dialog delivery is the most enjoyable. He makes even normal lines into funny ones. Kadar khan is as usual at his best. He is suitable for pa-in-law roles. Amish looks beautiful and Aftab is better in this movie.Nothing much to say about direction. Music is okay. I have seen this kinda moves played by Govinda before. But still i can enjoy sasur damad stories. Screenplay could have been better. Aftab's comic timing is OK. But Asrani's comic timing is excellent. He played the sidekick of Kadar Khan. He is suitable for such kinda roles."
