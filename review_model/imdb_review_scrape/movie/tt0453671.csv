" Garam Masala - A wonderful laugh riot !","One of the more sensible comedies to hit the Hindi film screens. A remake of Priyadarshans 80s Malayalam hit Boeing Boeing, which in turn was a remake of the 60s Hollywoon hit of the same name, Garam Masala elevates the standard of comedies in Hindi Cinema.Akshay Kumar has once again proved his is one of the best super stars of Hindi cinema who can do comedy. He has combined well with the new hunk John Abraham. However John still remains in Akshays shadows and fails to rise to the occasion.The new gals are cute and do complete justice to their roles.A must watch comedy. Leave your brains away and laugh for 2 hrs!!!! After all laughter is the best medicine ! Ask Priyadarshan and Akshay Kumar !!!!!"

" movie is amazing must watch","on the contrary to the person listed above me i felt that this movie was really funny particularly in the scenes were there is a lot of mix up. i don't want to give the plot and the storyline away to the people that haven't watched it yet but i will say that Paresh Rawal does not have an extensive role such as past Priyadarshan movies, for example, Hera Pheri and Hungama. Paresh Rawal does an amazing part in the little role given to him, John Abraham does equally well, Akshay Kumar has proved that he is no less in this movie like he had from Waqt and almost all his movies after Andaaz. Even though all three heroins in this movie were at a debut they did a pretty good job of acting particularly Nargis who is very good looking and hot. i would say that if you liked Hungama or Hera Pheri this movie is a must watch." 
" Fast, funny and fantastic","Garam Masala is one of the funniest film I've seen in ages. Akshay Kumar is excellent as the womaniser who has affairs with 3 girls and engaged at the same time. John Abraham is Amusing at times and this is one of his best works so far. Paresh Rawail is superb as usual in most of his films. The director Priyadarshan has delivered great Movies in the past. Hera Pheri, Hungama and Hulchul being some of the Best. Garam Masala is his funniest film he has made. The three newcomer actresses are average. Rimi sen doesn't get much scope in this movie. I was impressed to see how Priyadarshan made a movie with a simple storyline of a guy having a affair with 3 girls at the same time. All 3 girls have a day off in the same day and end up in the same house. Packed with loads of Laughs, this is one Non stop Entertainer." 
" It is a good film.","This movie was a fantastic comedy. It had a lot of comedians star in it like Akshay Kumar,Rajpal Yadav,Paresh Raval and John Abraham.Rimi Sen was good at playing Akshay Kumars wife and so were all the air hostesses. Mr Hot as Mac (Akshay Kumar) and Mr cool as Sam (John Abraham) are two fashion photographers who like the same girl Maggie (Neha Dupia). When John Abraham cheats on his work he becomes Akshay Kumars senior and Akshay Kumar gets really jealous because his flat has to be given to John Abraham and Neha Dupia starts liking John more. Akshay Kumar wants to be better than John Abraham so he finds a flat and he is going out with three different girls (Nitu Chandra,Nargis Bagheri,Daisy Boppana)." 
" Good film!!","Now i really liked this movie, it was so funny.Both Akshay Kumar and John Abraham are brilliant actors, i think after watching this film they should do lots more films together in the future.Akshay Kumar gets himself into a bit of trouble by dating 3 women at the same time, but the way he handles in when one comes out of the door and then the other one was just so funny to watch, he acted really well int his film and i hope that he makes more great comedy's like this one in the future, John Abraham plays his best friend, he plays his role really well and he is so underrated i am glad that some of his amazing work has got noticed but he is a really Good actor. i just love John, Neha Dhupia has a small role in this film and plays it well.The muse is really good i really recommend this movie to everyone." 
" Hiarious!","These are one of the movies that don't require any brain or thinking, it's a very funny time pass which you forgot in the next hour or so. I was really surprised with John Abraham's acting he usually playing the gangster like character with the emotionless face,so from that to playing the complete opposite and does it successfully,by managing to shine amongst the comic geniuses such as Paresh Rawal and Akshaye Kumar. I was also quite surprised with the Akshaye's 3 girls because there roles don't require much talent but mostly moaning about Akshaye's dissapearence(to the other girls) i was surprised as they managed to establish and actual persona and you could differentiate between them which is a good thing ,also majority of songs are good,it is colourful and fun so on a boring Sunday evening this will sure lighten your mood." 
" best movie ever!!!","this move was friggin hilarious!!! funniest I've seen in a while, akshay and john kick ass as always, and the chicks are hot too. the story is awesome, lots of great jokes, and whoever reviewed this before me is an idiot. to him i say that u are not of Indian background so u wouldn't understand the humor u moron. don't rate movies u don't understand. what did u watch, the subtitle version where majority of jokes are lost in translation? thats what i thought jackass. akshay kumar is the best actor ever and proves once again his versatility, he can do not only action but comedy as well, and is excellent at it. john has proved himself as well, this is his first comedy role and he was also excellent at it." 
" A huge disappointment to what could have been a potential blockbuster","I had tremendous expectations from the movie, which was marketed really well and had all the ingredients of a potential blockbuster. The casting was done really well with all great comedians in Akshay Kumar, Paresh Rawal, Rajpal Yadav, and the really popular John Abraham. The cast was given a storyline that was really good (although a copy from Jerry Lewis' movie Boeing Boeing), and in the hands of a director that has proved class in comedies in his previous creations (such as Hera Pheri, Hungama, Hulchul). I think the sold house in the first weekend of its release was truly disappointed with the movie. There were no original moments of laughter in the movie with most of the jokes pretty stale and tried out previously. The plot, although not original, was pretty new to the Indian cinema and was the only saving grace of the film. But that too seemed too hastily done. To me it just seemed a good story line taken to the drain with some bad direction.All in all, it just seemed like the film makers wanted to get the movie over by Diwali and hurried up in the production. I really didn't believe I would be saying this but - I would not recommend watching it really, and would seriously wait for it to release on DVD to rent it out." 
" Garam masala means here garam mamla!","GOOD MOVIE WITH LOT OF COMEDY.AKKI AND JOHN CHEMISTRY IS NICE.PARESH RAWAL IS DECENT AS AKKI'S HOUSEKEEPER WHO IS ALSO USEFUL IN HIDING HIS SECRETS.THIS IS A SITUATIONAL COMEDY WHERE AKKI AND JOHN MANAGE THREE GIRLS AT A TIME.THIS LEADS TO GREAT CONFUSION AND HILARIOUS OUTCOMES.WATCH IT IF YOU HAVEN'T" 
" Very funny","This movie made me laughed a lot it was so hilarious that I watched this a billion times before I like the songs they were superb to listen to Akshay Kumar was superb john was good others were hilarious This is a must watch every fan of either akshay or johnMy rating is 8/10 or 4/5 starsMust watch" 
" Good comedy","This film is an example of how good Akshay Kumar is in comedies. He is great in his role; he deservedly won the filmfare award for best performance in a comic role for his performance. John Abraham does his part well alongside Akshay in the lead roles. Paresh Rawal did well in his supporting role. Manoj Joshi and Rimi Sen did their parts well as did Neha Dhupia. The story of this is one that promises the audience a lot of comedy scenes, and it doesn't fail to deliver them. The music isn't that good to be honest. Still, it is worth watching for the comedy.Verdict: good comedy - definitely watch it. I give it 7.5/10" 
" Another good comedy after No Entry.","This would've been a sure fire classic had they chosen ALMOST ANYBODY ELSE for John Abraham. This guy is an awful actor. Be it comedy, drama, tear-jerkers etc. He stinks. It seemed like at some point Priyadarshan realized this too, and pretty much had him jumping around like a monkey in order to make his solo-scenes a bit funny.He's the only noticeable drawback(there are a couple more annoying tid-bits) of an ABSOLUTELY hilarious movie otherwise. Best comedy to come along in Bollywood since Hungama, IMO. Like Hungama, it's a situational comedy carried on the shoulders of a brilliant screenplay and of course,Akshay Kumar. This is probably his best performance to date. He better be a shoe-in for best comedian at every award function. AK's always been good at comedy, but he takes it to a different level here. The body language, the facial expressions and just the way he delivers every line. It's a genius performance. The packed theater was going nuts for pretty much the entire length of the movie and I don't think I've ever seen such an atmosphere for a Bollywood movie here in USA.Garam Masala doesn't have one "lead" heroine. It stars 3 incredibly HOT+Beautiful girls who I thought did a fairly good job. Pretty sure they are all making their debuts. Paresh Rawal is solid as usual, although his routine wears itself out after a while. Rajpal Yadav is his typical annoying self(sick of his over-the-top act in every movie). Rimi Sen has nothing to do.Overall, definitely worth a dekho. I'd say it's FUNNIER than No Entry, and that's saying a lot. Could've been even better had they chosen someone a little more competent than John Abraham.8/10" 
" 2 Grown Men Over Acting and Chasing Girls for no Apparent Reason","The first half hour of the movie had a steady pace and introduced the characters. however all of a sudden everything was happening too quick, a lame reason for Akshey Kumar to date 3 girls, very loud over acting by both Akshey and John Abraham. Neha Dupia was the highlight of the movie, Paresh Rawal did well but not as good as his performance in Hera Pheri. overall this movie was the biggest disappointment the film does no justice to its trailer. save your money and don't watch this movie, watch Hera Pheri and Hungama again!summarising it: a cheap stage show performance and appearance to the film no story or substance, the plot was extraordinarily non-sense good music by Preetam the man who bought us Dhoom! keep it up! movie shot all in one room, new comers (female cast) were okay as it was their first film but established actors like Akshey and John totally disappointed an established director like Priyadarshan gives his worst movie ever!" 
" 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣","Excellent movie , full fun from starting to ending , superb acting by #akshay , john , rawal ;" 
" Laughter masala","Garam masala movie is a amazing comedy movie.The movie revolves around 2 friends who proposes air hostesses and brings them into their house and the fun begins when all of them come in the same house.The performance of all actors are really great especially Akshay Kumar and Paresh Rawal's role.The songs are great especially kiss me baby song.The plot is good and everything is good in this movie.This is one of best comedy movie after hera pheri and andaz apna apna.This movie is worth watching and I highly recommend them who love watching comedy movies and especially Akshay Kumar fans and you will never get bored everytime you watch."
