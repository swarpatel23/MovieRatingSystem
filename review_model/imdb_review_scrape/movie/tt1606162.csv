" So worth it","First let me say I'm a VERY sever critic of films. I hate it when I go to a film on a recommendation and walk away disappointed. So I was SO grateful when I came across this Gem. This was fun, it had action, and sweet little love theme. Not to forget the up and coming actors. they did so well. The actor who played Arjun, Amar Sidhu, he has this silent quality and depth to him. Like Collin Firth in his role as Mr. Darcy, were there aren't words but their eyes and body language speaks volumes. The Girl, so cute. The film left me asking about human nature and how much can we really can change about ourselves and our nature. This is a great story that anyone can watch and enjoy." 
" You have to see this film!","My friend Raj and I went to India to visit his family earlier this year and we went to go see this film since it had just come out. I didn't understand it because it was in Hindi and it had no subtitles. It was well done. The action sequences were really awesome. I forget bollywoodish films are long but this film was not and it it was done well enough for me to understand exactly what was going on. My friend Raj really like it as well. Im waiting for it to come out on DVD so I can buy it. If you like a different kind of action film with Hollywood effects then I highly recommend this film. its one of those good films that are made and missed" 
" Awesome","So I watched the film this weekend. Was surprised to actually have liked it. I didn't know what to expect but it ended up being really cool. I really enjoyed the action scenes. Im also now in love with Amar Sidhu... He's HOT! I recommend it for all those who like action films, drama's,thrillers or just a good time. The only thing I would change is to give the lead actor more lines. After I watched the movie I went online and researched the movie because I wanted more information on the movie and actor. It looks like he's going to be in another movie next year and Aakhari Decision will be released next year in VOD,etc.. Can't wait!"
