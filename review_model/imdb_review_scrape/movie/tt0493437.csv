" ASMM - A good laugh!!!","I watched this movie last night just because of Ritesh Deshmukh. What a talent!!! He is a brilliant actor. He looks way much better than Koena Mitra or other girls in her female getup, very sexy and attractive :-) All credits go to him!!! The movie was really nice and many factors contribute here. Rajpal Yadav and his assistant, Chunky Pandey as a Nepali, Suniel Shetty, Anupam Kher and many others give you a very good laugh. I got never bored in this movie. It is a good time-pass. I recommend the viewers to watch it if they want a relaxing and light fun movie. Some scenes are not good for kids, be careful if you are planning to watch with your kids. Enjoy this movie!!!" 
" If there is nothing else to do...","then may as well watch this movie. Mind you - its a mindless film for the storyline is thinner than a toilet paper. Having said that, the subplots have been knitted well and so are the characterisations. Witty one-liners will evoke some good mirth. The songs are good as well.The direction is sleek, or rather not sloppy. Actors have a good timing amongst themselves, which is a key factor. Celina is the weakest link (you can see that she is waiting to blurt out her lines and the task done!!!). Riteish is the screen stealer. Shreyas, Riya, Koena, Sunil Shetty, Jackie and Anupam were okay. Chunky Pande's Nepali track was good. After aping SRK of Mohabbatein, this time it was Big B of Sarkar who was the victim of Rajpal Yadav, seriously the guy is a powerhouse of talent.All in all, let me reiterate - watch this only if you have nothing else to do on a DVD." 
" Crap","Promos promised a comedy film but must say here the comedy is so bad and so terrible that you die complainingI saw the film in a multiplex and was bored till deathOkay let's analyse the problemsIt's the problem with most comedies nowdays, they cram too much and too many characters in the film and it gets boringThe slapstick borders on stupidity and vulgarity which spoils the showThe film actually has a plot going nowhere and as usual they try to make a comedy out of the chaos Sangeeth Sivan's KYA KOOL HAI HUM was a good comedy at least in parts here however thinks go awryThere are soem funny scenes like the Suneil's portions or Ritiesh's dressing like an aunt but sadly the film mostly comes across like a badly made comedyThe comedy is too often too badly handled to make you laugh and looks too amateurish The Jackie plot is bad The Shreyas- Riya subplot is okay but deadRajpal's part is funny but on the whole the film is a circus of boredom The climax is the worst partDirection by Sangeeth Sivan is overall mediocre Music is okayAmongst actors Ritiesh has a blast as a women and continues his dependable act Shreyas is average Riya Sen is forgettable and also Koena Mitra Suneil is funny in many scenes Jackie is weird Rajpal is hilarious when he spoofs SARKAR Chunky is funny as Nepali Don Sanjay Mishra is as usual" 
" Comic Crapper","The movie is supposed to be comedy and u can watch one time u cant be bored as a timepass. Ritesh Deshmukh, Chunky Pandey & Rajpal Yadv is excellent." 
" Amazing Non sensical movie.","This is so aweful a movie that its actually awesome. Loved every one's craziness in the movie. Its funny. Really funny." 
" Awful!!!!","Then again. 99% of our movies are garbage!!! This is bottom of the barrel - There is no cohesion, the jokes are so idiotic (except the occasional PJ's that manage to exude a chuckle), terrible songs, unbelievable stupid acting (Celina Jaitley - u might need to visit your acting classes) and lousy, lousy, lousy script!!! Mostly what bothers me are the first two comments in this review : they are the representation of the dim and absolutely unintelligent Indian movie goer who will thrill at ...well absolute corn!!!! That and talentless directors like this who fall in the league of the David Dhawan's - all of whom should be thrown out of the industry for encouraging collective stupidity in Indians!!!"
