" All in all it's a cop drama that keeps you intrigued and entertained till the very end.","As Enemmy begins we see a meeting of builders who pay protection money to a powerful criminal named Mukthar Memon (Zakir Hussain ) in an almost obligatory fearful manner. The film's plot deals with the unexpected disappearance of this cache of money, 500 koka's to be precise, on a Raigad Highway which is ambushed by an armed and highly skilled foursome. The anxious don in an act of madness goes on a rampage suspecting his competitive mafia top bosses and begins a gang war in the city. He wants his money back and will go to grave lengths to take it even if this means bringing the city to a standstill reflecting very poorly on the government in power. Director Ashu Trikha showcases how bloodshed can be a result of cunning moves from higher ups or officials almost like leading lambs to slaughter. The men instructed to handle the case are headed by Sunil Shetty (Eklavya Karmarkar, fondly known as Bhau), who we see return to a role he is most comfortable in and that's full blown action. He plays the cool, suave and calm plain clothes leader of the special Unit 9. It's been a while since we've seen Anna in action which almost makes me forgot what made him a star back in the 90's. He comfortably jumps straight into the action with a raid on the Don's hideout, based on information from our 2nd Unit member and planted mole in Mukhtar's gang, Mahaakshay Chakraborty. The other 2 support roles are played by Kay Kay Menon (Naeem Shaikh) and Johnny Lever (Eric Collaco). Amongst a group of actors so diverse and talented I thought it would be an uphill battle for a youngster to shine. Given a meaty role, Mahaakshay has stood the test, with full marks on the emotion and definitely above average in the action. What i admired most about the portrayal of Unit 9 was the realistic and raw feel of emotion and camaraderie amongst the officers. 'Brothers of the sword' of sorts, whether it was the maturity of a boy to a man in the size of his pegs or an accusation being filed each man backs the other up. Unit 9 functions like the 3 musketeers except there are 4 of them. They are best of friends personally and professionally. Unity is strength here as well as all for one and one for all is the spirit amongst them. Eklavya's friendship with Naeem goes back to their childhood days a bond which is strong and powerful. Mukhtar the Don is now behind bars but the gang war continues, with a reputation and possible votes at stake the Centre decides to send in a specialist. Throwing gasoline over an already raging fire and in enters Mithun Chakraborty as Yugantar Sharma to temper the situation in Mumbai city. Here's where the twist in the tale takes places as he soon realizes who those 4 masked bandits are and the cat and mouse chase begins. Unit 9 here are the perpetrators and the investigators. It's always a treat to watch Dada on screen, the most underrated cinema legend in his own right I thoroughly enjoyed how he cracks the whip singly on each member of Unit 9. The story boils down to an intense police drama with a mixed bag of emotions from belonging to distrust to the literal taking a bullet for a brother. A sensational shootout results in the killing of Naeem Sheikh (KK Menon) as well as members of the don's gang in the cross fire. A vast array of emotions are showcased here from internal confusion, shock and extreme anger. Members of Unit 9 reach the spot to see their fallen comrade. Grief plus arguing with CBI man Yuganthar Sharma begins and from a blame game this develops in to a quest as the men now are determined to get justice for the killing of their fallen comrade. The matter at hand and prime focus is to bring to justice the dreaded Don. The story may seem cliché at points from the use of clandestine detective tricks, unnecessary over running of lines, a horrible item number to an I've Seen This Before ending but all in all it's a more emotional take on a cop drama that i can remember in recent times. I've definitely seen better work from Zakir Hussein in the past and feel he's better with a menacing touch than a tapori don! Johnny Lever has been underutilized and should have been allowed to provide some comic relief. At times he looked caged. All in all it's a cop drama that keeps you intrigued and entertained till the very end. Enemmy throws light on a Mob-Police-Political tainted System and a dangerous nexus plus how the 3 of them co-exist and flourish side by side each feeding off the other. From the Top to the Bottom how corrosion of conformity exists and how anybody could do anything for a price as well as ambition. The enemy is truly within us and society's weakness is reflected and a can of worms is opened up. How has corruption, taking the easy way out and the greed for money eaten its way from law enforcement to leadership is what the film asks You? The film also shows several actors and characters in their own space and is intriguing with its numerous twists and turns. Enemmy throws light on various serious issues. Why would those who upkeep the law resort to stealing or robbery? The film showcases the grave steps officers take to make ends meet and protect their loved ones. Truly a multi starrer with suspense, action and exposing a sordid system which confronts all of us. A sign of the times! Is Material greed and wealth the only solution to your problems? If you're rushing into theaters to be entertained like I do then this is definitely worth a watch." 
" Mithun trying hard to relaunch his son","Many times father's try hard to launch their kids, Earlier Rajkumar Kohli tried and tried to relaunch his son, with flops like Virodhi, Aulad Ke Dushman and finally Jaani Dushman(2002).Feroz Khan too tried to launch his son again and again after his debut Prem Aggan(1998) and then Jaannasheen(2003), Now Mithun follows suit, he doesn't direct yet the film is produced by his wife. The film brings back Suneil Shetty after a hiatus, his last release was Loot(2001) and Picture Abhi Baaki Hai(2012), Perhaps this too is one of the delayed films. The film also has Kaykay Menon trying to fit in a masala scenario while Johny Lever too joins as a lead in this film for once doing a serious role though he does have a lot of comedy too.The film is directed by Ashu Trikha(remember Deewanapan, Sheesha). The story is sort of twisted but the screenplay leaves a lot to be desired. The film tries to satiate everyone, but in the end comes across half baked. Mithun's character looks stupid, he has a sixth sense which helps him analyse the situation on his own which doesn't come across convincing. The characters are aided with families and clichés. However the going-ons do get interesting, especially when game plans are played but the end is typical and clichéd.Even the action scenes in the end are overdoneDirection by Ashu Trikha is good in parts Music is okaySuneil Shetty after a long time returns in a lead role, he does a good job. Kaykay Menon proves his talent yet again Zakir Hussain is badly typecast, Mimoh Chakraborthy or MahaAkshay is still fat and has a long way to go, though he does show improvement yet he needs to work on his voice and expressions(at times) and his weight. Mithun is as always superb in his role which is stupidly written. Johny Lever is good in a serious role for once, Priyanka Upendra is okay as Suneil's wife, Akshay Kapoor seen after a hiatus is good in his role, rest are okay"
