" Interesting idea with a nice twist","The film does not deserve all its bad reviews! I was ready to face an absolutely ridiculous Bollywood, instead I found myself intrigued by it. Perhaps it's not to everybody's taste a controlling, twisted and obsessive story. However if you are you won't find anything terribly wrong with this film.It does not deserve such harsh critics." 
" a bad movie with a bad director","this movie is totally horrible don't believe all the good reviews you hear about this movie they are all lies truly Aaditya Datt you suck why couldn't they just make a love story Sonu Sood's character really wasn't needed he's a really great actor i've seen him in Yuva he was great what the hell was this a shy character you're so stupid and lame Aaditya Datt you're terrible this is a terrible movie and terrible music Himesh Reshammiya it's only good when he directs music not when he sings what were you thinking all in all this movie sucks and hopefully the director of this movie will not come up with any crap Tanushree Dutta is a bad actress anyway and this movie makes Emraan Hashmi is a great actor this movie makes him look bad god why doesn't anybody say anything bad about it i know i did so here you go a bad comment on a bad movie next time people choose your movies carefully you may have no idea how bad they can turn out to be" 
" Boring banaya ye film ne. NONSENSE MOVIE","Aashiq Banaya Apne is one of the Worst Bollywood scripts ever seen. The movie was expected to be a Hit, because the Music was terrific and most Bollywood listeners were hearing this. The music stormed the charts and made Himmesh Popular. The same cannot be said about the film, with a complete lousy storyline. Thats right, another love triangle witness a million times in Bollywood. This time, one of the Actors Emran Hashmi has a negative attitude to life. He is involved in selling drugs, beating up women and having a rude attitude with people. But, the Actress Tanushree Dutta who is suppose to be a decent and soft person falls for him. She even sleeps with him to prove that she loves him, in a bad setting but good sex scene. The twist is a complete garbage that does not make any sense. Emran has given us one good performance in his debut movie Footpath. After that he has made the most boring movies ever till date. Sonu Sood is another lead actor, who looks bored and makes the film boring. Introducing the Ex Model and very sexy Tanushree, in a poor movie with a below average performance. She may do good in the future, but her first two movies, This and Chocolate sucked. The good thing is the music and her otherwise a big disappointment" 
" A weird kind of Cruel Intentions...","I didn't know what to make of it at first. The ending really threw me off but let's not get into that yet. That and I heard a really nasty rumour that the actors in the film with the exception of Emran Hashmi actually paid the film-makers to star in the film. Yikes! Well then, Tanurshee Dutta plays a sexy and sweet college girl named Sneha whom most guys admire but are afraid to approach. Okay, let me give Tanurshee some props for pulling off sexy in this film without looking slutty or stooping to low standards with her dress code. There, and let me also say that when the film first starts, she behaves like a movie-extra who can't act but this was her first film, so give her a break! Her moderate acting chops picks up later on. Cool, so on to the next character played by Sonu Sood. His name is Karan and he's a very close friend and classmate of Sneha. Naturally, he secretly loves her but doesn't have the guts to tell her. Enter Emran Hashmi, who plays Vikram AKA Vicky, the party poster boy type whom everybody knows and loves (despite being a newcomer in town) and he loves them back, especially the girls (whom he can't seem to keep his hands off of). He is a childhood friend of Karan's and enters the film in a scene celebrating some accomplishment by Karan's father who is a rich business tycoon. Upon seeing Sneha at Karan's party, Vicky is smitten and doesn't hide his affections from her. Sneha, who has never gotten such upfront attention from a guy before (usually because they are all afraid of her beauty) slowly begins to allow herself to fall in love with him and eventually they get all hot and heavy. Soon, Sneha loses her virginity to Vicky (prepare yourself for the love scene, especially if you're not used to the way Bollywood does more provocative than Hollywood! AND DO NOT! I REPEAT, DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM WITH YOUR OLD-FASHIONED Indian PARENTS OR ELDERS) and after-wards, weird situations start to arise that show her another side of the boy she fell in love with as she threatens to kill herself in the wake of the madness. Karan comes to the rescue, and after a few blah! blah! blah! scenes, they get engaged but that weird ending I was speaking about earlier comes into play and then you begin to understand why the movie is shot in flashback, as well as why the movie opened with the shot of three gurneys wheeling the three teenagers into the emergency room with another corpse in tow. This film did not do Emran Hashmi any justice acting-wise, Sonu Sood and Tanurshee Dutta are the real stars here, pay-cheque or no pay-cheque!" 
" My first Bollywood musical experience","Having scanned through the DVD and having somewhat enjoyed the music and dancing, I was surprised to see a very negative review in the User Comments. Then I watched the movie. It was pretty bad. The surprise is that BOTH guys are bad but she ends up going for one of them anyway! The songs were the highlights of the movie but they had problems such as the abrupt change of location (to London) or the way both male leads appeared to share a single singing voice. That said, I'm tempted to buy the soundtrack at the store that rents the DVD movie because the music and the songs were enjoyable on their own. But don't expect a lot if you choose to view the movie." 
" Extremely disappointing experience","I have been watching Hindi movies for ever. Always found something worthwhile. This movie ruined everything in the last ten minutes and threw the viewer in an abyss of disbelief. I can't believe the makers made such a huge blunder. Apparently there was no sanity check done. I wouldn't be surprised if people wanted their money back. I wish I hadn't watched this movie. All involved in making the movie especially the caste should take this as a low point as a team. Don't Watch This Movie. The music was excellent. The acting was above average. Editing and continuity were very good also. Credibility was intact till the last 10 minutes. It seems like the writer wanted to extend the mystery to the end and then twist the conclusion beyond comprehension or rationale of any stretch." 
" Worst Indian movie I've seen","Having been introduced to the massive amount of cinema that India has to offer, it's amazing how many great movies they've created. It was only inevitable that I would come across one of their bad movies. I was really surprised at how it fell apart so much in the second half. In the first half, it's bad because everything is so clichéd. I don't need to see a lot of Bollywood movies to recognize all the stuff about the dancing and the love interests and everything. Clichés are something we have in all media around the world.It's the second half that really makes this bad. It went from a romantic comedy to like a horror movie. Then it became a mystery. It goes through so many genres at one time, it's really hard to follow. This is also where the acting really starts to come off as bad. It's mostly unpleasant and everyone here just seems to lack clear motives for the weird scenarios. We see all the clichés with Sneha taking the posters off, looking at herself in the mirror, etc. I'm glad to have seen a bad Indian movie just for something different. *1/2"
