" Of great screenplays, dialogues and performances","There used to be a time when Bollywood was overly glamorous, the middle class always in awe of the rich, law that was still being written and order that was established by the ruling underworld mafia and when, a crore of rupees really meant a lifetime's wealth. Lives were less valuable back then and nobody lit candles for the fallen. This was when the city was called 'Bombay'. Director Milan Luthria takes us to 'Once upon a time in Mumbaai' in the era of a smuggler who sought control of the seas and his apprentice who changed the meaning of crime altogether.The inspiration for the character of Sultan Mirza (Ajay Devgan) was certainly derived from the erstwhile RobinHood Smuggler Haji Mastan Mirza. Sultan's attire, his background, his occupation, his interest for the welfare of the poor, his love for a Bollywood heroine and production of movies are obvious parallels to Mastan. Devgan portrays his character with ease and familiarity but makes a remarkable impression with the dialogues written by Rajat Arora. The movie is a bible for the man on the streets in Bombay. Each one as if a quotation by a philosopher and yet dramatic in effect when combined with a sharp screenplay. The result is what you would relate to as a Salim-Javed penned underworld drama. Sultan's love interest is the glamorous looking Rehana (Kangana Ranaut) who falls for his one-liners and cleanly ironed white outfits. Kangana looks gorgeous and performs naturally in a role that also is familiar territory for her. She even over-shines the beautiful Prachi Desai who could do with a meatier role next time.In the aftermath of the '93 serial blasts, a despondent ACP Agnel Wilson (Randeep Hooda) regretfully narrates the tale of how two criminals shaped the future of the city and how he trusted the wrong one among the two to turn away from the underworld. His mistake resulted in just one of them surviving the decades of criminal dominance when the ghoda was the law and Shoaib Khan's apathy to the city, was the order. Although Emraan Hashmi has portrayed similar negative roles in the past, he adds some sleekness to a reckless character who would shape up to be Dawood Ibrahim. Shoaib's ambition makes him greedy, zealous and rash. Eventually, his ways diverge completely from the more humble, loop-hole smuggling approach of Sultan's who, as everyone acknowledged, never caused harm to the city but instead, bestowed it with generosity towards the masses. This disparity in attitudes is supremely entertaining. Here we have Sultan enraged over Shoaib's management of his business in his absence, ordering his men "Shehar Saaf chahiye mujhe!" The combination of such screenplay and dialogues is essentially the strength of this film and the reason why it has its place in the hallmark of crime sagas.Pritam's two romantic tracks make up whatever good there is in the album. Mohit Chauhan's melodious Pee Loon and the combination of Tulsi Kumar and Rahat Fateh Ali Khan make Tum Jo Aaye a hummable track in the romantic rains.Milan Luthria directs his best after the promising 'Kachche Dhaage' with some powerful writing by Rajat Arora. Numerous scenes are packed with metaphorical dialogues that will build the required tension without any drama. The background music, cinematography and the crisp editing also make this a commendable thriller. Perhaps there hasn't been a more worthy tribute to the real Dons of yesteryears and even though, the climax does not bear any resemblance to characters or events in real life, the end-note pays a serious tribute that sums up the story and leaves us with a helpless grasp of events that have taken place in real life, due to a real person. "Beyond the myth, lies Mumbai's greatest betrayal."8.148 on a scale of 1-10." 
" Overall a great movie by Milan Luthria, who didn't mess up the movie with hardcore violence & scenes, must watch it!","ONCE UPON A TIME IN MUMBAAI – CATCH IT ( A- ) Once Upon a time in Mumbaai is quite different take on the Mumbaai Don world which is less brutal and hardcore then Company or Satya An amazing movie with amazing performances by all the leading actors Ajay Devgan yet again proved that he is par excellence his portrayal of Sultan Mirza is effortless and complete natural Imran Hasmi in his Bad Boy Avatar again proved he is the best Bad boy Around in Bollywood.

Randeep Hoda proved that he has abundant of talent Gauhar Khan's item number was Classy and looks Hot as Always. The music of the movie is really enchanting. Overall a great movie by Milan Luthria, who didn't mess up the movie with hardcore violence & scenes, must watch it!" 
" More than a one-time-good movie with great music & good dialogues","If you like storytelling, you are going to enjoy it. Once Upon a Time in Mumbai is all about the rise two smugglers / gangsters in Mumbai i.e. Sultan Mirza (played by Ajay Devgun) and Shoaib Khan (Emraan Hashmi). Movie begins with ACP Agnel Wilson (Randeep Hooda) narrating the life stories of these two smugglers. Sultan Mirza, a poor boy, who enters into this business at a very small age becomes very strong and powerful man of mumbai due to his strength, bravery & wisdom. He also divides mumbai into different zones and allocates each of them to different smugglers and chooses the seashore of mumbai for himself. Sultan soon becomes messiah of mumbai by rescuing poor from difficult situations and giving charity to needy.On the other hand, Shoaib Khan, spoiled son of a police inspector, becomes a thief. Shoaib's father requests Sultan Mirza to help him in this regard and Sultan helps shoaib in establishing a electronics shop which shoaib in unable to continue due to his temperament & reputation. Shoaib requests Sultan Mirza to let him work with him in smuggling business to which Sultan agrees. Here the plot of the movie resembles with that of film Company in which Ajay Devgun inducts Vivek Oberoi as his worker and The Company gets more strengthened. Shoaib Khan soon proves that he is fully capable of working for Sultan Mirza and Mirza's reliance on him increases till a time comes when Sultan goes out of city to execute his future plans and makes Shoaib the caretaker in his absence. This is the point where the problem starts between the two.Director (Milan Luthria) has done a wonderful job by recreating the era of 70's & 80's. First half of the movie is better than the second half due to well-balanced comedy, romance, action; nonetheless, movie does not loses grip in the second half. Rajat Arora (writer) has also done a good job with good dialogues; nevertheless, end of the movie could have been made better. Idea of Sultan Mirza's character seems to have been inspired from life of Haji Mastan Mirza who was a smuggler of Mumbai and had nothing to do with underworld (that is drug, narcotics etc). Ajay Devgun has been given the same look which Haji Mastan Mirza was famous for i.e. white dress, chauffeur driver Mercedes car, imported cigarettes in hand, big donor / charity worker. Haji Mastan also married a bollywood actress and so does Sultan Mirza in the movie who marries top actress of his time Rehana (played by Kangana Ranaut). Although roles of both ladies Rehana and Mumtaz (Shoaib's love played by Prachi Desai) are very small; both actresses have fulfilled their duties. Here, credit also goes to costume designers who were successful in giving the actors & actresses the accurate 70's / 80's look.As far as acting is concerned, this is one best movies of Ajay Devgun's career (performance wise) and its seems that this role could not have been suited on any other actor apart from Ajay Devgun. Two negatives of the movies are 1) Emraan Hashmi - who gave his best in the movie but (unfortunately) couldn't break his lover boy's image 2) Randeep Hooda - who has not been utilized properly. It would have been better if Shoaib Khan's role was given to Hooda due to the arrogant, anger look on his face.Pritam's music is one of the strengths of the movie. All the tracks have been composed wonderfully and according to the moment at which they have been placed in the script. Singing great Rahat Fateh Ali Khan's "Tum Jo Aaye" & "Pee Loo" by Mohit Chauhan was splendid.Last but not the least, apart from the songs, superb background score was the biggest plus of the movie especially in the latter half.Conclusion: Highly recommended to all the cine goers especially to gangster / mafia movie lovers." 
" A Fantastic experience in the 70's","I am thrilled to see these kind of movies from my childhood.We never get tired of stories of Underworld Dons in India.This one is a fabulous effort to recreate the golden era of Mumbai...the 70's and the director Milan Luthria successfully does that.Basically it is the story of a Smuggler Sultan Mirza and His Confident Shoaib khan.Running parallel to this is the romantic tracks of both of them..Sultan is a man of the people.having reached Bombay during the floods, he had smuggled Gold and watches from his childhood and on the other hand Shoaib, the spoiled boy of a police constable, was interested in Stealing. the Film progresses with the Sultan's Reign in Bombay, His eventual fall and Rise of Shoaib khan.It is told from the viewpoint of a police officer .Ajay Devgn gives a Rock solid performance as Sultan Mirza.He portrays the role with ease......even though its similar to his role in Company. The first half entirely lies on his his shoulders.Emraan is a treat to watch.He is extremely good in portraying the angry young man who is hungry for Power.His best performance till date......The 2 heroines are hardly there ......there is not much importance to them.....Romantic tracks were good........ Dialogues are spectacular.....which keeps us glued to our seats...choreography is excellent.....Songs are top class......Pee loon is excellent...Other songs are also very good... .Altogether, This Movie is a treat to watch for Real movie Lovers.....It is indeed an outstanding Cinematic experience considering the boring movies releasing nowadays......Well for Me, I had watched it 2 times in theater....looking for ward for the DVD release......" 
" Excellent","Ajay Devgan rocks in this movie. a must watch movie. Excellent. You seldom get period dramas in Bollywood which are not about historical characters. This year that way has been very lucky that way. Couple of months ago we had Badmaash Company and now we have Once Upon a Time in Mumbaai. Of course both are completely different from each other, the first being set in the fast 90s and the latter being set in colorful 70s. And director Milan Luthria makes enough efforts to make OUATIM look very authentic and worth a watch for its settings.Settings apart the film has its pluses with some superb performances and great dialogs. However the problem with the film is the not so new storyline and the very slow screenplay. Though the characters are well established and well rounded the writer takes the entire first half to do that without much movement in the story. And then as you expect fireworks in the second half it fizzles out too fast.OUATIM is the story of two gangsters. While one was ethical the other was reckless. It has inspirations of the characters of infamous smuggler Haji Mastan and now infamous don Dawood Ibrahim. The film is about Sultan (Ajay Devgn) who labored through his childhood and became a smuggler as he grew up completely ruling the sea routes. He however always preferred keeping the city clean and never smuggles which was against his conscience. Shoaib (Emraan Hashmi) is inspired by Sultan's life as a child and wants to it as big. He is a son of a police officer but has no inclination towards the law. As he grows up he makes his way to Sultan's gang and proves himself good enough to go up the ladder fast. However his reckless ambitions soon outgrew Sultan and he decided to take over the city on his own.The story is built on the line – 'behind the myth is the city's greatest betrayal story'. The screenplay does not give much importance to the betrayal. The slow pace of the first half could be a put off. Also funnily Sultan and his girlfriend Rehana never seem to age as they continue to look the same even as Shoaib grows from a child to rustic young crook.The film has its pluses. Luthria has taken care of everything – right from trains to cars to sunglasses to shoes to buildings! Everything takes us back to the 70s. Luthria handles the dramatic moments well and great use has been made of dialoguebaazi. All actors have come up with some memorable performances. Ajay Devgn's overpowering presence is matched by Emraan's charm. Kangna Ranaut and Prachi Desai do their bits well though they don't bear many consequences on the story itself. Randeep Hooda is effective as the police office.Overall, 'Once Upon a Time in Mumbaai' is an entertainer. It does not need any effort to be understood of liked. It is the mere magic of characters created that makes this film worth watching." 
" Relive the 80's era of Indian Cinema","It is a well researched movie, the movie is in a flash back narrated by the inspector Agnel. Its about the story of 2 young boy in Mumbaai with the dream of ruling the queen city. The movie is directed keeping in mind the era when the story would have happened and that is what adds reality on celluloid. The background score of the movie is just awesome and after watching it people may get mad about it ,as I am searching all over internet to get that music. It gives the feeling of olden era's music with the new instruments and that will give you a great effect.The movie is power packed with good one-liners and any one who has interest in dialogs will just love it. Ajay Devgn acting is just superb ,he is well suited for the character that he is portraying .Emraan Hashmi is a bit disgusting because of the dialog delivery,yet he is good.Overall , the movie is watchable and it will surely remind you the era of olden Indian Cinema." 
" The Rise & The Fall","Lets get straight, if you think Once Upon A Time In Mumbai is a biopic, you're wrong. A police officer(Randeep Hooda) who once traced the changing face of the Mumbai Underworld narrates all his experiences and all his unintentional mistakes which affected everything. Almost every movie-goer has a fascination for gangster movies, and yeah it does not disappoint(almost).. It recreates the era which so many of us have left behind and those who arrived on this planet after 80s.Once Upon A Time In Mumbai is a story that talks about the entry of mafia for the first time in Mumbai and things unfolded in course of time. It talks about the rise and subsequent fall of the King, and the emergence of the Prince as the super power. It talks about the dialogues which ruled 70s era. It talks about the chic retro look which was the trademark of that era.The plot does resemble with lives of Haji Mastan(allegedly played by Ajay Devgn) and Dawood Ibrahim(allegedly played by Emraan Hashimi) but whatever is, the screenplay is engrossing and keeps you hooked until you feel about complaining for the length when things get slow in the second half and gradually in the end. But, the dialogues do get lots of claps and whistles in not few but many scenes. Recreating the bygone era is tough and the director, the writer and the art director deserve brownie points for giving the film that authentic feel.As for acting, Emraan is sure to break free from his lover boy image with this film. This is his finest performance to date. Ajay Devgn has become repetitive, his dialogue delivery and expressions betray you many times, although his character is very strong and he has played it effectively. There was nothing much to do for the ladies(Prachi and Kangana), but they managed to portray their roles 'beautifully'. Randeep Hooda, too, performed well. Pritam's music( in spite of the fact the music is never really 'his') is an ace. But, it was the background score which left an lasting impression even when the movie ended.When the screenplay is powerful and engaging, direction has to be brilliant. Milan Lutharia successfully recreated that era and his work is exemplary. There should be a special note of the dialogues, also written by Rajat Arora( screenplay) which are fantabulous.To conclude, I would just say, go for it if you really are interested in the dialogues which no longer have there existence these days(of course allegedly) My Rating: 7/10 Thanks & Regards" 
" One of the best Hindi movie......in a long time!!!","This movie is excellent. The drama in the movie is pulsating and very gripping. Direction, Acting, Story and Songs all of them are very well done. The story line is very strong as it relates to Haji Mastan and Dawood Ibrahim. There are very few songs but all of them are superb.The only bad part I would say is the romance in the middle was little dragging and Prachi does not fit the role of a gangster girl. She does her acting well but you can tell she does not feel very comfortable with some of the roles. This is definitely one of the good Indian movies in a long, long time. Not to be missed." 
" Fascinating, eye-opening film of Mumbai's demise","There are numerous films on the present-day Mumbai underworld, but it is fascinating to see how it all started in the newly independent country.The too-big-to handle metropolis, once freed from the chains of the British reign, also lost a strict and strongly exercised system of law enforcement. It is interesting to see how the new, immature government is unable to retain control and power goes to "Sultan" Mirza. It is equally shocking to witness how Hashmi's unquenchable thirst for power and victory leads him to usurp Mirza's position, and increases Mumbai's filth. The police inspector points out the riveting truth that all along he thought he was in a battle of good vs. evil, where the evil is Mirza and his group, and the good is the former innocence the city possessed. However, it ended up being much more complex where the fight was between evil vs. more evil (Mirza vs. Hashmi).The inspector's recollection of "the death of Mumbai" is both eye-opening and tragic. Terrific plot and great performances." 
" Very good movie which recreates the 70s era perfectly. Ajay Devgan steals the show","Milan Luthria is not a big director in Bollywood, but he's done very well here. The direction is brilliant, as is the cinematography. It recreates the 70s era perfectly.The film tells the story, from the point of view of a police officer, about Sultan Mirza (Ajay)who went from nothing to the ruler of Mumbai, and Shoaib Khan (Emraan),the only son of an honest police officer who wants to make it big so badly.The performance by Ajay Devgan is simply superb as Sultan Mirza; there isn't a role he cannot do. Emraan is good as Shoaib Khan, but I think his serial kisser/lover boy image just got the better of him here. Kangana Ranaut is good as one of the female leads, as is Prachi Desai as the other one. The problem is that Prachi is that she isn't as convincing in the movie in her role as Kangana is in her role. Still, Prachi has made a mighty good effort.The film is full of good dialogues; a lot of them are one liners. I can tell you one thing for sure: you won't forget them that easily after you've seen it. The music of the film is great. The song 'pee loon' stands out from the lot.Verdict: A good gangster flick providing wholesome entertainment. One of the best films of 2010. I give it 9/10" 
" One of the best n my fave gangster flick from Bollywood.","I saw this with my family in a theater, first day last show. Revisted it recently on a DVD which i own. The sheer amount of effort that went into making this film is breathtaking. The locations, the time frame, the costumes, the set pieces, and the acting. Everything was top notch. It is a biography of Haji Mastan, a famous contraband smuggler, gangster, films financier n real estate businessman played very well by Devgan. Mastan was not a dreaded don because never in his life he had killed anyone or shot a bullet at anyone. In fact, in certain places in South Mumbai, he was referred as the Robin Hood. Devgan, for his part turns in a fine performance as Mastan aka Sultan. He gives an amazing performance, from tough to tender, he hits it all. You're actually rooting for this guy, because of where he came from, what hes trying to achieve, the ingenuity and strength that it takes to accomplish it, even though its all completely illegal. Along with Mastans story, there is another in the film, that of notorious criminal n bomb blast mastermind, Dawood, played extremely well by Hashmi. He's an opportunist, power hungry n a criminal mind and in the end he's a pathetic and isolated figure. It's clear from Hashmi's performance and the film's overall attitude that this is not a figure to admire or about whom one should hold illusions. The songs were good, the one liners were witty n macho. The  film also has one of my favorite actor, Randeep Hooda." 
" A Nutshell Review: Once Upon a Time in Mumbaai","You can probably name a number of films with titles "Once Upon a Time in..." where we go back in time to eras in cities or countries past, with room for plenty of astounding stories to be told, complete with that nostalgic peek in a time long gone. In Once Upon a Time in Mumbaai, writer Rajat Arora and director Milan Luthria bring us back to the 60s to 80s Mumbai, with the city having to taste the onslaught of the Mafia operating from within, carefully carving territories amongst themselves so that they can each operate in their own spheres of influence as mooted by a certain Sultan Mirza (Ajay Devgan), with him forsaking land to his peers and opting for control over the sea routes for his smuggling activities.So begins the tale of a much respected gangster, well known throughout the city for his no- nonsense approach and honour amongst thieves, yet possessing that heart of gold and compassion in his willingness to help impoverished folks where the authorities can't, himself having started from an almost impossibly poor beginning and working his way up through a variety of con jobs. But one gangster alone doesn't make this the blast from the past tale it got touted to be, with the story enveloping two other key characters, with Shoaib Khan (Emraan Hashmi of Tum Mile) the protégé gangster wannabe who looks toward Sultan as a source of inspiration, but possesses a hungrier and larger ambition and an obsession to emulate his idol, and on the other side of the law, ACP Agnel Wilson (Randeep Hooda) who at first thought that taming the city will be a piece of cake, but soon finds himself embroiled in a battle larger than what he alone thought could handle.It is the intertwining of the lives of these three characters that propel the narrative forward, with the two gangster characters Sultan and Shoaib finding parallels with real life mobsters Haji Mastan and Dawood Ibrahim who reigned over the Mumbai underworld during the same era. It charts their respective path to infamy, with each having to take a different route and approach in terms of what morals they are willing to compromise in their grip for power and ownership of the city, with Mumbai herself becoming that object of desire. The story takes pains to tell how each possesses a certain amount of ingenuity in their dealings as gangsters to make up for the lack of action sequences, while also highlighting their differences that will eventually see them cross paths into foes, with the police willing to take a backseat to see how it will all play out.As with a typical Hindi film, romance is never left far behind, and ample time is given to mirror the kind of relationships each man develop with their lady love. Kangana Ranaut glams up for her role as the superstar actress Rihana who sweeps and got swept off the floor by Sultan in their fairy tale like whirlwind romance, while that between Shoaib and Mumtaz (Prachi Desai) is almost the exact opposite with a more down to earth relationship riddled with issues since Mumtaz cannot reconcile Shoaib's desire to rise to the top through whatever means possible. Worst of course come the humiliation that Shoaib's initial failure bring about, and that uncontrollable dogged temper that sees him never wanting to get stuck back in the rut again.So we have a clear distinction before and after the interval, beginning with the measured setting of the pace for the introduction of all the key characters and their respective rise to power, and after that the beginnings of true rivalry formed. Ajay Devgan comes hot off the successful Rajneeti, and his growing screen charisma is never beyond doubt as he chews up each scene he's in. He brings a non-threatening Sultan when he's with the poor masses, and switches to bad-ass routine with ease when he finds himself crossed and betrayed. Emraan Hashmi too holds his own against the heavyweight actor, and his emulation in wanting to be Sultan goes well thanks in part to the costume designers, who work wonders in decking all of them in retro garb, and credit too to making Kangana Ranaut quite the clotheshorse here, whose character unfortunately got forgotten midway.Randeep Hooda perhaps got the role that elicit the most laughter, because his ACP Agnel has a penchant of speaking through idioms, which of course in a way exaggerates speech. Being a non-Hindi speaker, I'm definite some meanings got lost in translation, but I got the idea since the filmmakers tried their best to bring this sense of stiff, unbelievable dialogue through to the subtitles. In some ways, the look and feel of the film was hyper-realistic, alluding to how certain elements got deliberately fictionalized beyond reality through stylized sequences. The main electric guitar riffs for the theme will also become that ear worm long after the film ends, and got used to perfect glee when it comes on to accompany a swagger or two.Beginning in the 90s and having the story told in flashback by ASP Agnel, unfortunately audiences will find being left high and dry when the story ends, with plenty of narrative room for another film that will bring us full circle to how it all started. A lot of questions still remain given the events in the last 5 minutes of the film, and this will only, and possibly be addressed should a follow up be made. Otherwise we'll left with quite the cliffhanger, though this isn't reason enough why you should stay away from it. An arresting storyline with a competent cast delivering their roles with aplomb still makes this quite the blast from the past trip worthwhile, with Ajay Devgan continuing to show he can hold down that leading man status." 
" What a poetic movie!!","I had this movie in my watch list for almost a year! I finally watched it! I am glad I DID!. The characters, chemistry between each of them, acting, cinematography, everything is amazing. BUT the most importantly the poetic dialogues are really amazing and so delicious to listen. Ajay Devgan top 5 movies!Hats off!" 
" Evil...with a heart of gold.",""Once Upon a Time in Mumbai" is obviously a film that is trying to capitalize on the success of such classics as "Once Upon a Time in the West" as well as "Once Upon a Time in America" by Sergio Leone. Fortunately, this Indian film is good enough that it's more than just a film borrowing a title!The story begins with a cop trying to kill himself. He survives and then tells the following story about corruption. First, he talks about an anti-hero named Sultan. Sultan is a mobster but he has a very, very strict code of ethics. In his own way, he's a decent fellow and manages to unify all the mobs of Mumbai--bringing them peace and keeping them from selling drugs and destroying the poor. In essence, Sultan is a bad man with a heart of gold.Then the story weaves in the story of Shoaib. Shoaib is almost nothing like Sultan. Instead of being a poor orphan like Sultan, Shoaib was raised by a policeman...but Shoaib is completely amoral, angry and vicious. For a while, Shoaib goes to work for Sultan but, not surprisingly, there's a falling out and I really don't want to tell you more...just see the story.This film has a lot going for it. It's extremely cinematic and well crafted. In particular, I really liked Ajay Devgn (Sultan) as he was a nice combination of power, decency AND corruption--not an easy role to play. Well worth seeing and exciting...though some might dislike the downbeat ending. Considering the characters were based on real mobsters (yes, you can ignore the text at the beginning that says it's all fictional), you can understand the tone of the film at the finale." 
" The Real Stars are the Dialogues","Its an out an out stylish electrifying crime thriller which reminds me of the good old 70's cinema. A movie full of magical background score, powerhouse acting by Devgan and Imran and above all super cool dialogs (listen to them carefully, they are the real winners). The movie portrays rise of smuggler Sultan Mirza (Ajay Devegan) in the Mumbai crime scenario. Sultan is a stylish smuggler who made money by trafficking the contra-bands and used his might to help out the downtrodden. Sultan loves Mumbai and wants it to be clean and for that objective he cuts a deal with other operating crime lords and distributes the areas of Mumbai among themselves so as to bring the inter gang rivalry to an end. Because of his larger than life image, many youngsters start to idolize him and among them is one small time thief, Shoaib (Imran Hashmi).Shoaib is a son of a policeman and does not have much of a future yet wants to reach to the top and live a luxurious life and for that he is ready to anything. Soon he crosses path with Sultan and starts working with him. Soon Shoaib rises in ranks due to his daredevil attitude and a shrewd mind and wins the trust of Sultan. He soon becomes the close confederate of Sultan. Where Sultan had some principles for life, Shoiab has none and thus when Sultan leaves his temporarily leaves his Empire, he entrusts Shoiab with the responsibility.However, because of power and money hungriness of Shoaib and Sultan's never compromising attitude towards certain principles, both head for a showdown.Though loosely based on the lives of legendary smuggler Hazi Mastan and his protégé Daud Ibrahim, this flick takes creative liberty to tell the story with many imaginary sub plots yet the director is able to maintain the realistic feel to the movie. However, the end is bit clichéd but then "who is complaining"!! A worth a watch for the style, panache, background score, decent performances by Huda and Kangna and once again, for its dialogs. So till the next time, "Duaon me yaad rakhna"" 
" Provides wholesome entertainment throughout","After a long time, a movie that manages to entertain throughout its 2 hour+ running time has released in theaters. I went to see this movie in theaters just for the sake of it, but surprisingly, it turned out to be a pleasant and worthwhile experience. The story, screenplay, dialogues, direction, acting, music, etc. were all top notch. Let's start with the performances of the main leads (in order from best to least): 1. Ajay Devgn- Is there any role this man cannot play? His dialogue delivery, costumes, and screen presence were impeccable. He carried the movie brilliantly with his intensity and his ability to show a range of emotions. His performance makes the trip to the theater worth it. 2. Randeep Hooda- Before this movie, I had no idea who he was. I was surprised that he could make his presence felt when he was next to a seasoned, intense performer like Ajay. He delivered his dialogues well and carried himself well throughout the movie. 3. Emraan Hashmi- The serial kisser of the industry surprised me with his performance. He acted very well and was able to make his presence felt. He also showed a great range of emotions.4. Kangana Ranaut- It is a known fact that she has ability to act, but she also looked beautiful. Her chemistry with Ajay was also great. She played her role effectively, although I don't think that this is her BEST performance to date, but certainly one of them. 5. Prachi Desai- She plays her innocent, doting character very well. This is only her third film, yet she can make her presence felt. Out of her 3 films (Rock On, Life Partner, and OUATIM) this was my favorite. Now let's move on to the music by Pritam. All of the songs are great, but "Tum Jo Aaye" is the best for me and is easily one of the best tracks of the year, as well as one of Pritam's best. The soundtrack is one of the best works of Pritam's.The next element is the direction by Milan Luthria. He incorporates Mumbai during the 70s very effectively. This can easily be said to be his finest work to date.People criticize this movie for being "predictable" but where did they get the idea that this movie is of the thriller or mystery genre? It is meant to entertain, which it does very effectively and is one of Bollywood's best crime/mafia movies. Also the violence was not gratuitous, as the fight scenes showed the true violent, psychotic, and dark nature of Shoaib (Emraan's character). So if this is not worth the price of the ticket, then what is?"
