" A Jolly Good Courtroom Drama! Pleasurable!","Each & every time you move forward to have a closer look and a leaner ear to the drama, this movie scores for Jolly LLB is a fantastic thriller drama which showcases the maddening reality of India, its judicial system and people's wrath & lax attitude on crime.A standing ovation to Boman Irani for such a beautiful and genuine performance as a senior advocate. Saurabh Shukla is faaantastic as the judge and towards the end, his ire-ridden, frustrated reply to one of the lawyers leading is just the best scene of the movie; JLLB runs for a sweet little about 2 hours with no cheap humor or blatant slapstick as one is continuously experiencing in Bollywood genres. Arshad Warsi is poignant and dramatic after his "Zila Ghaziabad" villainy look. Amrita Rao didn't have much to play, maybe that is why she was casted. After "I Love You Mr. Kalakaar," this is her latest role and she does good enough. The rest of the cast is good as the direction is cheeky.Screenplay is straightforward while some songs made me yawn because the script didn't need them to entice me. The balance of thrills, spine- chills and oohs and aahs and whoas is equal on the two halves. Plus, since it is a based on a true story which is indeed based on vendetta, Jolly LLB is a pretty good entertainer with not much left for the audience to interpret other than enjoying it. I could forget some loopholes or plot points for this as it made my day.BOTTOM LINE: Watch it if you have a thing for courtroom dramas or if you get emotional by the callous judicial system of India. 'Cause this one is a genuine entertainer based on sheer facts.Can be watched with a typical Indian family?

" This is (Indian) court. Nothing happens fast here.","Indian movies and novels, being influenced by the American pulp fiction, have always shown the courts as a place of enormous drama (and entertainment) whereas the reality is polar different at least in the Indian courts. For decades and decades, the Indian filmwaalas have shown the artificial, non-existing courts to the Indian audience on the silver screen. However in the year 2013, the Indian courtroom dramas seem to have come of age through Jolly LLB.Through the activities of a petty lawyer - Jagdish Tyagi, nicknamed as Jolly, the filmmaker has shown the courage of showing the real courtrooms of India. All the courtroom scenes are so realistic with the judge, the lawyers, the plaintiffs, the defendants, the cops, the witnesses, the court-staff; all appearing real and not filmy that it won't be an exaggeration to consider this movie as a landmark movie in the history of Bollywood. It's definitely a path-breaker and therefore, we can expect many more realistic courtroom dramas on the Indian screen in the times to come.Our hero Jolly (Arshad Waarsi) migrates to Delhi from Meerut on order to rise in his career of a professional lawyer. He finds public interest litigation (P.I.L.) as a means to be in news and get quick name and fame (which is expected to turn into money in future). Seeing a high profile lawyer Raajpaal (Boman Irani) winning the case of his client who is actually guilty of crushing some innocents sleeping on footpath under his car, Jolly decides to play a gamble which if he wins, is likely to take him much ahead in his career. He files a P.I.L. to reopen that case and then the game of checks and checkmates starts between the rival lawyers inside as well as outside the court. The hero wins in the end after passing through lures to withdraw, hardships and danger on his life. His Meerut-stationed sweetheart - Sandhya (Amrita Rao) plays the role of an eye-opener and a motivator for him when he is slipping from the correct path.Never before any Bollywood movie has shown such a real judge who is a normal human-being with all the weaknesses expected in the normal folks. The character of the judge (Saurabh Shukla) is the best developed one who is shown as more or less honest(perhaps to keep the movie optimistic and making the hero only as the winner in the end). He wants to do justice but not very much keen to improve the system. Corruption is rampant just beneath his nose but he is not bothered about it (perhaps because he feels there's little that he can do about it). He knows that a major part of his duty is only to give dates of next hearings of the cases and that he performs by consulting with the lawyers only. He seeks the help of the high-profile lawyer to get a good flat while sitting on the chair of the justice itself. He mostly remains subservient to the high profile lawyer but realizes the significance of his chair and the power inherent in that in the climax.The inexperienced lawyer in this movie wins the case because fortunately for him, the judge is not totally corrupt and his conscience is still alive. Had it not been, then ? Then our hero would have met the fate of most of justice-seekers in India. The climax has been designed with an optimistic twist which is seldom seen at least in the lower courts. But the complete proceedings and environment in the court have been depicted with utmost realism.How lawyers resort to rhetoric and hollow talks when they are exhausted of logic, arguments and facts, has been underscored very well in the climax through the character of the corrupt but highly successful lawyer - Raajpaal. The fact is, not only the lawyers, but the judges also go for rhetoric and nonsense comments when dealing with the cases, as if they have a license to say anything and everything. They want to become preachers for all but have they ever shown any concern for the corruption in the judicial system itself ? Arshad Waarsi has done exceedingly well in the title role with Boman Irani not far behind as the high profile but crooked lawyer. Amrita Rao has filled heroine's quota. The complete supporting cast has done perfectly. Especially veteran actor Ramesh Dev has delivered a touching performance. The actor in the role of a weak yet conscientious policeman (deputed as Jolly's bodyguard) is also very impressive. However the show-stopper is Saurabh Shukla (the session judge of Delhi).I term Johnny LLB as a highly realistic and hence, a praiseworthy movie. Kudos to its writer-director - Subhash Kapoor. While signing off, I reproduce the dialog of Raajpal for Jolly - 'Yeh Court Hai Mr. Tyagi. Yahaan Jaldi Kuchh Nahin Hota' (This is court Mr. Tyagi. Nothing happens fast here.' Very true. Nothing happens fast here, at least not justice." 
" Not Exactly a Comedy but nice one.","I've got to watch this movie in Dubai Reel cinemas for the first show and found it a good one to watch not like typical Action or funny movies.. they have taken a social issue and elaborated it in extensive and funny manner the small jokes in movie keep the interest of spectators. Arshad warsi and Bhoman Irani have done a good job. i was not able to find any real mistakes but still didn't get how Jolly was able to find the right person but the Police didn't find him, but such minor things doesn't matter and for the tag line "Footpaths are not meant to sleep for sure.. but they are not even meant to drive" :) Finally i would suggest all to go and watch the movie." 
" Strong enough","This is not the best courtroom movie ever made but will be one of the better ones. The movie does pack a strong satire about the systems in India.Many scenes are there just to add some comic relief but my opinion is that they do balance the load of the satire and set the tone for the movie.The change of character was a bit sudden and could have done with a little depth. The songs and dances were unnecessary (although Arshad Warsi is a great dancer). The twists are quite good.Unlike some other reviewers, I believe: Arshad's acting was quite good (but could have been better). Boman's acting was above average (but not great). Amrita's acting and diction were not up to scratch. Saurabh's was the best acting in the movie. The evidence was there. The decisions were made based on evidence, not on emotional speeches. Please keep this in mind and don't get carried away by the speeches. The story is set in very raw tones and inspired by reality.Some parts of the movie are not convincing but overall, I still liked it enough to give it an 8." 
" An Honest & Well-Intensioned Film!","'Jolly LLB' Directed by Subhash Kapoor, is An Honest & Well-Intensioned Film! It has a worthy, inspiring story to tell & bravura performances working to its advantage. This Is Good Cinema!'Jolly LLB' Synopsis: A small-time advocate goes head-to-head with a high-profile advocate, when the former re-opens a controversial case. 'Jolly LLB' works because the Screenplay is strong & progressive. The narrative is funny, inspiring & honest. The final act, stands out. Its wonderfully penned & executed. Subhash Kapoor has directed the film with utmost honesty & sincerity. He handles the comedic as well the dramatic portions like a pro. Cinematography is perfect. Editing is sharp. Music by Krsna is good.Performance-Wise: Arshad Warsi is competent. A consistently great actor like Boman Irani is flawless, yet again. Saurabh Shukla is on a roll. After his stupendous performance in 'Barfi', Shukla emerges a scene-stealer in 'Jolly LLB'. His portions are marvelous & his performance is among the reasons why those portions work. Amrita Rao is fine. Mohan Kapoor & Harsh Chhaya are efficient. Sanjay Mishra, Brijendra Kala & Mohan Agashe shine in cameos. On the whole, 'Jolly LLB' is a worthy watch." 
" A rib-tickling comedy which is a satire on Indian Judiciary System","Jolly LLB is a rib-tickling comedy which is a satire on Indian Court process and judiciary.A small time lawyer wants to make it big by enforcing himself in a hit- and-run case where 6 innocent footpath dwellers are mowed by a speeding car. From the director of "Phas Gaye Re Obama" , Jolly LLB is based on a true incident which grabbed media attention few years back. It also showed another incident where a pregnant woman was operated by a 14 year old lad. Jolly LLB also focuses on our poor judiciary where a single case is bought at the hand of big goons who desperately try to save their kids brushing their mistakes as act of innocence. Hats off to Subhash Kapoor for fearlessly depicting these events with ease. Few acts did catch my attention- the introduction court scene , the court fight scene between two music directors and the argument between Saurabh Shukla and Boman Irani will certainly bring down the house. Of course , the film has its share of flaw as well - the chemistry between Amrita Rao and Arshad Warsi , the unnecessary insertion of songs and dance (completely unrequired in this kind of cinema). 3 central characters - Arshad Warsi , Boman Irani and Saurabh Suhkla will drive you nuts with their admirable performances. Arshad Warsi not emotes well in comic scenes but is commendable in essaying serious role as well. Boman Irani , as usual , is marvelous. Saurabh Shukla as judge is simply fantastic. He is sure to make you laugh with typical Delhi accent and comic timings. Jolly LLB is pleasure to watch not just for its satirical humor on Indian Judiciary system, but always for its beautiful message on honesty and bravery." 
" Awesome film. Was highly anticipating its sequel. All the zest fizzled after reading that Arshad is not part of its sequel.","I saw this in theatre first day last show. I really liked Jolly LLB n I found it very entertaining and absorbing. In its satiric way, the movie is full of rich characters and plausible situations even if sometimes you can spot the cliché around the corner. Sometimes satire works as a magnifying glass to expose and better criticize something. Arshad unquestionably steals the movie with another over-the-top performance as the lawyer willing to risk everything. Superb performances by all. Special mention has to go to Boman n Saurabh Shukla. If u like court/lawyer movie, give this one a chance. This movie is an expose of the corruption, politics, and general crookedness of the legal profession. The movie does a good job of portraying both the human and systemic flaws of the legal system. Moreover, the movie balances between comedy n drama. Was highly anticipating a sequel. But lost all the zest once I read that Arshad is not part of the sequel. That is y I felt the need to write a review of this good movie even if it's very late. The only drawback was the romance angle n songs. But nonetheless, an awesome film." 
" While touching main problems in India, Jolly LLB delivers with humor.","JOLLY LLB is a drama/comedy movie directed by Subhash Kapoor, starring Arshad Warsi, Boman Irani & Amrita Rao.The film revolves around the case of Rahul Dewan, who drove over a pathway, killing several laborers in the bargain. The main lawyer hired by the Dewan family is Rajpal (Boman Irani) who is a respected lawyer amongst many law courts. On the other hand, there's a lawyer named Jagdish Tyagi (Arshad Warsi), also called Jolly by many. He's a failing lawyer with a girlfriend (Amrita Rao) annoyed with him at times. Rajpal wins the case eventually but Jolly doesn't feel convinced and starts looking for evidence, and files a PIL. The rest of the film forms who wins the case.Okay, so I saw Jolly LLB twice in the cinema because it was actually pretty good. When I saw the trailer of this film, I wasn't convinced whether it would be good or not but it striked me as pretty decent. It isn't as humorous as it seems, it focuses more on the court case. There are some funny scenes, especially the final hearing.The acting was extremely good from Arshad Warsi and Boman Irani, although I felt that Amrita Rao didn't have that much of a role.Except for 'Jhooth Boliya', I didn't like any of the songs and felt they were extremely unneeded in the film and was just added at awkward parts of the movie.In the end, I will say that Jolly LLB is an extremely good movie. Its good to see it as a family, its good to see it as an individual. It touches key points of Indian society, and it touches a bit of humor along with it, just not to bore you. Jolly LLB is definitely worth it." 
" Jolly LLB works because of its bigger point - decency is for all and worth fighting for","I agree with the comments, but Arshad Warsi was the best as shown from Meerut. The problem is with director who was unable to get Arshad into the Character. Everyone knows Arshad Warsi character in "Lage Raho Munna Bhai".The film is a fun watch if you are willing to overlook its minor indulgences and the slow pace of the first half.Jolly LLB's first half meanders a bit, featuring a clumsy 'daaru' song and a Meerut that mysteriously hides - but boy, does its second half hammer things home. With crackling scenes between Jolly versus Rajpal (Irani deadly smooth, like velvet soaked in blood) and Rajpal versus judge Tripathi (Shukla in a brilliant show, hysterically yelling, Gavel kidder-rakha Ha?!", thundering at Rajpal, "Sit down! Yeh Meara court Ha aapka club nahin!"), the action becomes electric. Drama builds as Jolly (Warsi, highly endearing and impressive) finds his voice. Jolly's astonishment at Rajpal's callousness - "Footpath sone ke liye nahin Ha" - Jolly responding, "Footpath gaudy chalane ke liye Bi nahin Ha!", mirrors the aam aadmi's bewilderment and determination to fight.Jolly LLB works because of its bigger point - decency is for all and worth fighting for. Using bittersweet satire and plot twirls, the film shows corruption even used against the corrupt. Despite that weaker first half, this truly becomes a Jolly good show." 
" Brilliant","One of the best films I've seen in a very long time. The movie grabs you from the first intense car chase scene and never let's you go. The movie is full of realism drama. The performance were great. The movie get's you involved, It's gets you to think. Revolves around the biggest problems of our nation- "Justice". Brilliant Storytelling, Investing Characters, Great Dialogues. It delivers everything that an audience expects. Some performances deserve a filmfare. Thanks to Subhash Kapoor's directing that he delivers one of the best films of the year or maybe all time. Quite shocking that the government didn't cut out few scenes. I guess in a way the government is accepting that these practices do involve in our society. Overall Jolly L.L.B. deserves 8/10." 
" Watch it to witness a rare entertaining court room drama from Hindi cinema.","As suggested by the title the film is all about a confused struggling lawyer Jolly, who is still caught in the dilemma that, should a good lawyer fight a case for his own client or for the right justice which should ideally punish the culprit. Frankly, I was expecting a very light kind of comedy featuring Arshad Warsi in the lead, as shown in its promotional campaign on the channels. But it was really a pleasant surprise to see that it was not at all a comedy but a much important film than that, revealing the ugly faces of two primary social security institutions of our country namely The Courts and The Police Stations.So evidently here is another example of a strong film promoted wrongly by the makers with a misleading message, which is sure going to affect its overall performance at the box office in the opening days. However if one forgets this avoidable step taken by the commercial promoters of the film then JOLLY LLB is no doubt, one of the better projects made in this particular genre of Court Room Dramas in Hindi cinema till date, which is bound to pick up fast as the word of mouth spreads.The film starts off casually with the same old cliché elements and an unwanted song but soon gets on track after this initial weak 20 minutes. And the moment it gets on line, JLLB turns into an interesting sarcastic take on the judicial system of our country, giving the viewer a solid shock just before the interval. Further post the break it thankfully gives you some of the best scenes in the recent times on the subject of corruption, greedy lawyers, on-sale policemen, fake witnesses, easy going judges and the common man caught in between these dangerous termites of our society portrayed bluntly.For instance, you must have heard that there is actually an underground bid held on the posting of SHOs in some important police stations of every city in the country. Now JOLLY LLB literally tells you how it is done in its own hilarious take. Plus it also has scenes where an old trembling policeman is appointed as the security guard for Arshad, a judge who calls the reputed lawyer "Sahab" repeatedly and then the so called respectable lawyer who openly says, "Yeh Court Hai, Yahan Kuchh Jaldi Nahin Hota" in front of the same judge, without any respect or hesitation. Eventually such intelligently directed scenes lead to a thoughtfully written climax in the court room itself which forces the viewer to clap for the proceedings on screen just effortlessly.In fact, here the important distinctive plus point of the film is that it doesn't end on that normal routine Courtroom Drama sequence filled with immense tension and suspense. But here since one can easily predict the climax, the director puts in the much needed entertainment factor back in the last 40 minutes which in turn takes the film to a different level altogether. As a result the viewer has a great enjoyable time in its final reels where Arshad is highly emotional, Boman is extremely annoyed and Saurabh Shukla reinstates the spirit of justice back in the court quite impressively. In few words, JOLLY LLB fills you with great enthusiasm as it ends with Arshad winning the case against all odds being the honest representative of the common man.On the flip side, the film does has its flaws in its completely predictable plot line, deliberately inserted love angles, unwanted below average songs and a misguiding promotional campaign. Yet, JOLLY LLB covers all these weak points with its strong merits and emerges as a clear winner in the finale as I felt. Admittedly, at one end the film has a regular kind of background score and cinematography but on the other it has some exceptionally performed acts entertaining you well enough in return of your amount spent on the theater tickets unarguably. Both Arshad Warsi and Boman Irani are simply brilliant as the two opponents fighting in the court, well supported by a superb act from Saurabh Shukla as the judge. And you can easily watch the film for these three fabulous acts put together only, if not for anything else. Plus with the three above mentioned towering acts, JOLLY LLB also has few small gems to offer in its supporting cast which include, Mohan Agashe as the big industrialist,Ramesh Deo as the canteen owner, Manoj Pahwa as the Jeeja, Sandeep Bose as the corrupt cop, Harsh Chhaya as the fake witness, Mohan Kapoor as the father of the ignorant boy and Sanjay Mishra in a cameo as the Police bid organizer. However though it was nice to see Amrita Rao back after a long gap, still she doesn't get anything significant to do in the film as per its theme.Overall, JOLLY LLB has 'a Rajkumar Hirani film' kind of feel which gives you full on entertainment in its content post intermission (which should be taken as a compliment for its director Subhash Kapoor). And since Hindi cinema has not really made many thoughtful entertaining court room dramas in the last few decades, therefore I would like to rate it as a must watch indeed from this particular angle. So do give it a chance and enjoy this powerful enjoyable drama with Arshad, Boman and the impeccable Saurabh Shukla having fun together."

Arshad Warsi,Amrita Rao." 
" Excellent performances backed by a water tight script","I knew about Jolly LLB, but it didn't appeal to me to watch it until I saw it was winning 'Best Story' awards at the Indian film award ceremonies, and I must admit I was very pleasantly surprised how good the film was. Jolly LLB does not ride on star power,or chart topping music, but more so a simple but effective script with solid acting from the main star cast. Arshad Warsi is obviously known for his comic timing, and it was on full view once again. It is great how he manages the comedy and the serious roll so effectively. Boman Irani is such a fine actor, and reminds me of the current day Anupam Kher with the versatility he offers a Director. He plays his roll with supreme ease, showing off his vast ray of acting talent. I absolutely loved Amrita Rao in her short but powerful role. She is such an underrated actress, and seems like she won't be ever considered as a main stream heroine, but performances like these will certainly do a great deal of good of good for her. The music of the film is nothing to write home about - it's pretty average, but the film doesn't need good music as it relies purely on the solid script. Overall I really enjoyed Jolly LLB and recommend it to anyone who isn't after a 'masala' film." 
" Good direction - excellent performances","I normally never watch unknown film on a Saturday but this one caught my attention and managed to make me watch the full thing !! I simply loved the direction and the performances. Though it was not a great story to begin with but the performances of Boman Irani and Saurabh Shukla makes it a worthwhile experience. I have a renewed respect for Saurabh Shukla. Boman is as usual clean as water - he is a born actor. Arshad was also convincing. Kudos to the director for pulling of a decent movie with some excellent direction !! The state of Indian judicial system is in full display. Amrita Rao had a small role but she was good. The other character actors were too good and refined in their performance. The only thing that seemed out of place was the songs - could have been avoided." 
" Its a "Jolly" good movie","It is definitely worth a watch. You may not watch to watch it over and over again though. Arshad Warsi has acted well, but Boman Irani steals the show. What a performance. Not to forget Saurabh Shukla, who is as usual fantastic. The story is great, screenplay is good, the dialogs are fantastic and the direction is really good.It can be watched with family, though the language used in some scenes has a very rugged touch, but it is understandable. The songs I think were not needed.Its such a pity that good movies and performances like these go un-noticed because of lack of hype.All in all its a watchable movie, and I would say its a must watch for Boman Irani's performance." 
" what a comedy!","JOLLY LLB works for yet another reason: It's a fascinating account of an underdog who locks horns with a much-senior, much-powerful and much- influential lawyer and emerges triumphant, after facing a lot of hardships. This slice of life film celebrates the spirit of the aam aadmi so admirably and capably that in his triumph lies your triumph! A satire on the judicial system, the film boasts of powerful courtroom sequences reminds you of NO ONE KILLED JESSICA, at times, but, most importantly, it has several poignant moments that you carry home after the screening has concluded. On the whole, JOLLY LLB is a power-packed courtroom drama. But, most importantly, it celebrates the spirit of the common man seeking justice and impartiality most effectively. Just don't miss this jolly good film!"
