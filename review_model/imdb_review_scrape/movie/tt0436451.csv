" Sunny Deol beating everyone around the bush","Jo bole so nihaal is a movie full of Punjabi (Indian) culture! Though I must admit, Punjabi's aren't as dumbed down as shown in this movie (I myself am one :-)A cop looking out for a bad-guy who's framed him, Sunny Deol (Nihaal Singh) goes all guns to get 'Romeo' the villain. In fact, he goes across the globe to the US, and does things 'his way' there!The plot contains too many loopholes to worry about it, and the humour - though funny at times - is not well executed.To be fair, if you like irrational action, then this movie is for you. There's loads of beating people up, god-like heroism, and a little excess of patriotism & religious fervor.I'd suggest going out for a nice dinner date, rather than spending on this flick -- unless you know you have the appetite for it!" 
" I Puked","I had to sit through this movie because I paid over a 100 bucks for it. It's hard to believe that a movie can be made that has nothing going for it. Idiotic dialogues wrapped up in gaudy phoren locations. I believe this the first movie in which the audience actually audibly groaned at the jokes that it tried to 'imply'.In addition to that, add two UGLY women who only got roles because they can "show off". I would never want to see anything that they had to show. BAD BAD acting, coupled with a story that is absolutely stupid, I feel stupid for having watched this movie. HELP! (sob) I can't even begin to count the flaws, there is just not anything interesting here. In a scene, two characters jump of a bridge into water, and later they are shown completely dry and the lady has her make-up intact. Plus, a character is not supposed to have a thumb, and in the final scenes, we plainly see the thumb front on. The FBI succumb to the trivial eccentricities of a village cop from India, ya right. And, what more...we have bird bombs blasting away an important building in New York, FBI plotting to kill the president of the USA, two bimbos, "religious sentiment", ah...the basic Bollywood mish-mash.If you are going on a date and want to set the evening up nicely, go to this movie. She will be so bored out of her brains, she'll do anything to make life more interesting ;)! It's a no-brainer!" 
" Funny Sunny rocks!","Sunny Deol tries comedy for the first time ever in Jo Bole So Nihaal, and he is successful at this, as he gives witty remarks and street talks the FBI (which he calls 'Fully Bewakoof Insan')! As you watch the movie, you will come to realize that Sunny's character, Havaldar Nihaal Singh, is the only smart character in the movie, so if you ever want to watch this film, do it for Sunny. I also like the 'No If! No But! Sirf Jat!' Sunny continues to be amazing in action, and now he adds comedy to his list. Although it is understandable why the movie became controversial, there was no intention of hurting anyone. Sunny was just being funny. The film also has its thrills and fun scenes, although the climax could have been better, but the boat chase in the Everglades was brilliant. If you want laughs, then just sit back and relax and enjoy!" 
" what was that?","it had been a long time since i had a headache watching a movie but i presume we should torture ourselves once in a while with such pathetic movies to appreciate the well-made ones.... the movie is about a simple constable of Punjab,nihaal singh(sunny deol) who is too sweet and innocent to be believed. the villain is played by kamaal khan by the name of romeo who is an international hit-man who kills a priest after doing an act of terrorism(i thought the character was supposed to be smart).romeo comes to apna Punjab on a mission and when nihaal singh tries to arrest him(for not having a revolver license) he fools him and escapes crossing the border effortlessly(wow!!!romeo should be given full points for fooling the security of both sides of the border).nihaal is suspended on account of helping the terrorist.as nihaal singh is the only one who has seen romeo , his services are asked for by none other than the FBI but apna nihaal wants to take romeo back to India and with the help of a female(Indian) FBI agent who is more interested in shedding her clothes than doing her duty, manages to do that. the movie is a drag and the scenes where nihaal's mom keeps on falling down every time nihaal bumps into the female FBI agent is plainly stupid and unexplainable. at the end of the day the movie does'not make sense and the humor is anything but funny.sunny deol should take a break and reconsider how he wants to take his career ahead. kamaal khan is promising in certain scenes. the woman in the movie provide the required glamor and flesh. simply a very avoidable movie." 
" Bad...Bad...Bad....","I misjudged the movie from the hype created with the blasts in India... This movie was the 'Da BomB'..... a bigger bomb than the one that was dropped in Hiroshima...Worst movie ever watched ....will think ten times before watching any Sunny Deol Movie... Please dude ask him to talk on a cellphone and not an IPAQ. The chicks were cute ...which was the only decent aspect of the movie. No need for a screenplay for the movie.. the songs can start whenever needed, based on the level of boredom of the movie.The music was bad too...This is what SantaBanta.com had to say ... "Sukhvinder Singh -"Rab jaane" (along with singer Kamaal Khan who plays a villain in the film) and Sunidhi Chauhan (trying to infuse life into a very mediocre 'Raat kuch aur tthi') to Jaspinder Nirula and Kamaal leave you thirsting for something beyond the immediate sensation. But alas, no salvation."Overall..."FBE: a Fully Bewakoof Endeavour"---IndiaTimes" 
" awful movie, retarded plot!","Totally awful movie. The movie started with so much promise. The opening half hour which shows nihal-deol in Panjab was funny, well shot and well acted but after that it was just too much to bear. Where do the bollywood directors recruit their "americans". Totally blah movie. Nihal singh or Sikhs are shown in a totally insensitive light and the portrayal is stereotyping. If such a movie was made in US it would be give rise to protest about such a portrayal. The movie was technically and story wise so shabby that it was embarrassing. As usual Sunny deol is the superman incarnate, which is okay but make the story have a little more sense. To be fair it had some moments of laughter but these were so far and away and were filled with banal plot in between.I love Sunny deol and prefer him to Arnold as the strong man in movies but this time the story writer, director and the editing team have totally let him down. Please stay away from this one :P!!" 
" Pathetic storyline, but has some good moments.","I came upon this film, when an Indian friend of mine recommended it as an introduction into the world of Bollywood. I must say, I am not impressed. The sound effects and special effects are so amateurish that I thought I had undergone a time-warp into yesteryear. I know this is supposed to be a comedy, but the way the film was cut and directed was what made it so funny in my opinion. Even with all its flaws, there were some good moments, however. The American FBI team might have been shown as a caricature in the film, but the actors did a fine job with such poorly written material. The scene with the kid eating the ice cream was funny. The best scenes were the Brooklyn Bridge chase scene and the scene after-wards when the FBI commiserate over the female agent turning traitor. That scene had the only real moment in the film and the acting of Thomas Tevana and Gary Castro Churchwell was powerful. All in all it was a poorly constructed film with a few good scenes. I hope to see better Bollywood films in the future." 
" P.o.s.","The movie was horrible! they had many intolerable items in the film that was disrespectful to Sikhism, for example in a song they changed a portion of a holy hymn to suit the needs of the movie! that is not allowed in the Sikhism religion. Sonny Deol should have known better than to make a film like this. You might say it was for the sake of comedy, but it was way overdone, and inappropriately shown. this movie is horrible, and not even that, the guy stabbed some girl on her stomach, and she died 2 seconds later! That is not possible, the person would bleed to death for way more than 3 minutes! This movie is not worth anyones time, i don't even know why i am reviewing this p.o.s., well later...Ps.The Movie Sucks" 
" Sat Sri Akaal","Watch out for this movie. This movie is Da Bomb. You have to go see it to have a lot of fun. Sunny is funny. Kamaal khan as an actor has done a commendable job. Shilpi Sharma is cute.Gary Churchwell sucks big time.....how did he even get into the set?Rahul Rawail has done an awesome job with th movie. The treatment is amazing. The movie has been beautifully shot in NYC and Florida.Hats off to N.R.Pachisia for giving us another great movie. The action and comedy is worth waiting for. Action has been done by a Hollywood guy...The movie has been shot very well in the US. Go watch this movie at a theatre near you .It's worth every penny." 
" A complete bullshit!","I made the biggest mistake of my life by deciding to watch JBSN. The film has nothing working in its favour. I was fooled into watching JBSN because of the singer-turned-actor Kamal Khan (remember Oh Oh Jaane Jaana?). But i was so disappointed because he can't act to save his life! He is simply horrible. Seeing Kamal Khan's acting, I advise all the singers to stay away from acting. Sonu Nigam's Kash Aap Hamare Hote, Jaani Dushmani & Love in Nepal and Shaan's Daman sucked big time. Acting is simply not their forte. So they better stop making a fool of themselves. Sunny Deol is so loud and irritating in both his action and comedy scenes! He is a good actor and tries too hard to tickle our funny bone but fails miserably. Sunny should keep his focus straight on action films and that is! Shilpi Sharma is wasted in her debut. Also, she shares no chemistry with Sunny and she almost looks like his daughter. I have said enough! I better not comment about the songs, choreography, cinematography, editing and most of all, direction. Because the film lacks in every department! It can easily be ranked the worst movie in Bollywood history! I beg you to avoid this crap! I give it 1/10." 
" Rating","Director: Rahul Rawail Starring: Sunny Deol, Kamaal Khan, Thomas Umer Tevana, Nupur Mehta and Shilpi Sharma Music: Anand Raj AnandVery nice Movies, i have watched it in cinema over south west London, THE story was nice with the songs, but i am concerned about the ban in India.'Jo Bole So Nihaal' is the story of a naive constable of Punjab police named Nihaal Singh, played by Sunny Deol. He has been bestowed with love from elders and youngsters alike. He is soft at heart but hard at work. But, his plain nature makes him fall a prey to easy tactics.And, it is where Romeo (Kamaal Khan), the dreaded mercenary, takes advantage of him. He uses Nihaal Singh to escape from law. Once out of bars, he goes on a killing spree from country to country. Back home, all hell loses on Nihaal as every one believes that it was he who helped Romeo to escapeExcellent movie you should all watch it. Saibhy" 
" Funny, superb and worth to watch","It is sweet funny movies, i don no why it is banned in Punjab? It hasn't got anything religious to offend someone. SUNNY DEOL is cool as always whether it is action or comedy, he should be the KING of Bollywood not that smoker Shah Rukh. Next project for sunny should be a role as a father. The second one i would like to see all three brothers, one sister and their mom and dad to do a movie together. I hope they will. Anyways, you should watch this movie to see other side of Sunny Deol which is comedy. He is as good in comedy as he is in his dialogues. Jo Bole So Nihal is not what i expected, i thought this will be a movie for grown ups. it still is worth to watch, a very good time pass. If you got funny sights in your life, you should not ignore this movie." 
" Awful","Is there a worst comedy ever? oh yes in Bollywood we have many but this is one of the worst films ever madeThe film has a decent plot but it's ruined with stupid scenes like Sunny going towards the heroine and his mom Sikri getting fits in IndiaEven the skin show is forced and then the game of Sunny to play Behaal Singh is worst and even Romeo comes across as a stupid idiot The film makes no sense and is a example of mediocrityThere are several scenes which are so stupid and also the entire track of the FBI suddenly wanting to kill the president is awful and so is the finaleDirection by Rahul Rawail is terrible, it makes even YODHA look a classic Music is badSunny Deol is himself, funny in some comic scenes and over the top in some and too loud in several portions but he manages to lend some credibility to his character- 6/10 The girls Shilpi Mudgal and Nupur Mehta are bad Kamaal Khan is a joke as the main villainArun Bakshi is okay, Surekha Sikri is hilarious" 
" Timepass movie","The movie is supposed to be a comedy, and does somewhat average.Don't expect this to be a great movie or take things seriously then u'll be thoroughly disappointed.The movie starts well. Nihal Singh a policeman of Punjab gets the chance to grab international terrorist "Romeo". But he is so innocent he believes in Romeo's story and romeo escapes. nihal singh has to catch romeo for this is the only way he can recover his and family's prestige.so he comes to newyork to catch "romeo".the comedy was good at the start but it dragged after that. The heroine and the vamp are dump and show a lot, as it is supposed to be.See the movie with full timepass mode." 
" Sunny deol best movie ever","This movie was so entertaining but I enjoyed watching the film and I enjoyed it as much it is superb and enjoyable to play and enjoyable to listen and Direction is good screenplay is superb background music is superb storyline is interesting Songs are really enjoyable Sunny deol steals the show kamaal khan was superb as the villain other cast were fine Overall my rating is 7/10"
