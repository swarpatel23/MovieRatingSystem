" Not for people who only like movies to pass the time","I normally very strongly dislike Hindi films. Most people who like intelligent, artful, deep films usually hate films from "Bollywood", and with good reason. There's a reason why Hindi films aren't seriously considered when there is a discussion of great films. Slumdog Millionaire doesn't count for obvious reasons.Delhi 6 is a film which finally made me believe that there IS potential in India, and a desire to make a film which isn't just meant to be spoonfed to the audience.For people who have spent their entire lives, watching films which are only what they are at first glance and nothing more, this film will be undoubtedly annoy and bore them. That probably means most of the Indian audience, unfortunately. And that unfortunately means, this film will not do well financially, and will discourage producers from making a wonderful film like this.Delhi 6 will not make sense to people who take EVERY SINGLE THING in a film literally and don't dig deeper to try and understand the implicit meanings. This film is wonderfully directed, acted, and very evidently produced with heart and love.I would definitely submit this film as the selection from India for the Oscar foreign film section. It's *that* good.Don't watch this if you're looking for a "masala" movie. If you're looking for a film which will make you believe in India's ability to make excellent movies, this is it." 
" I'm sorry Mr. Mehra, I underestimated you","I remember the time the song "Masakkali" hit our TV screens. I felt a good vibe about this movie, later found out that it was from the same director who did RDB, one of my favourites. Being a regular IMDb user, the ratings below 7 barely encouraged me to watch it though. Obviously, the movie never achieved the popularity status anywhere near to that of RDB.But for some reason, almost 4 years later, I decided to give it a try and I have to apologise Mr. Mehra for underestimating him. It is nigh impossible to emulate RDB but Delhi 6 shouldn't have done his prospects any harm. If there was anything like an Indian Oscar, Delhi 6 would have been a strong contender, considering the paucity of quality movies that get made in the biggest film industry in the world. As someone who is relatively familiar to the ways of Indian society and mentality, it was a stark depiction of the intricacies that form the gullies and chowks. The colours and noise and the varieties of personalities just illuminates the first half or so. The latter half shows the dark side, naivety, greed, ignorance, pettiness which can quite easily ruin a society.Nothing compelled me to write something here other than the fact that moviegoers have decided to rate it 6, which is a pity. No wonder, movies like Dabangg seem to reap financial rewards and recognition and the ones like Delhi-6 are left to stray into oblivion. I loathe bollywood in general, not so bollywood music, but Delhi-6 gives me hope." 
" Black Monkey","One of the most underrated Indian movie. Deals with custom tradition corruption overall Black Monkey inside us that spoils our society through us. Yes it is one of the underrated movie with the underrated star Abhishek Bacchhan. The layer are so thick in this film that you have to observe and should take conclusion from it. It is old as well very contemporaneous. We should contemplate the message delivered in this movie. It is very nice movie.Roshan has visited Delhi 6 the native place of his Grandmother who wants to live her some life here before she dies. Roshan gradually likes the culture and the people around.He falls for the girl Bittu who's father want her to marry soon. Unknown creature is haunting the city The black monkey Who is black monkey and it's consequences on the society that is the story. Movie is good with good messages. Music is another highlight of the movie with great composition by A R Rahman.It is nicely made movie but most underrated Indian movie." 
" Great movie...disappointed about the rating.","So this movie has an average rating of 6.2, which is quite disappointing for a film like this. It falls along the lines of Rang De Basanti. It is not a masala flick where you have drama, love, sex, music, thrills, laughs, tragedy, etc. This movie doesn't have much entertainment value, it is more about real life and how people behave (just like Rang De Basanti).Now about the movie. It is directed well and the story is simple. The pace was slow a couple times but it picked up during the climax. Although Abhishek and Sonam aren't great actors in my view, they have my respect for working in this film. You can read the plot to know about the general story.I would watch this movie again with friends and family. It is definitely a keeper and it's available on Blu-Ray!" 
" Bad, really?","Thankfully I wasn't sucked into all the hype of this film and just watched it months after its release, after the dust had settled down with the immense flak it was receiving. But to put it succinctly, the only thing wrong about Delhi 6 is that Rakesh Mehra made it after RDB. Period. Nothing more, nothing less.Had Rakesh opted to depart from the norm and do a completely different genre of a film- yes, then maybe, he would have pulled it off well, but a film like Delhi 6, which had the shades of RDB in it, certainly is not the wisest of choices for a follow up. Delhi 6 is like a toned-down RDB, less impacting, much more mellow, and just like anything- its expectations that would hinder one from enjoying it. From the way it had been criticized, I was expecting a heavily metaphorical film with abstract narration all over- I wasn't expecting much, and thats exactly why I give it a 9, because it exceeded my low expectations.I couldn't help but to think that the film is receiving this flak because of the strong anti-Abhishek sentiment, with many feeling that Abhi hadn't been aggressive enough in the film. But, thats the whole point of the film. That precisely is the USP of the film. Roshan is not a participant, the entire film is a journey through Roshan's eyes as to how he transformed from a mere observer of the society and later on became an active participant. He may not be your regular society-changing hero, but that is exactly Rakesh's intentions in this film. To just show to the audiences what he himself had seen through his eyes.The film's theme is also very self-reflective. The only major metaphor of the film is about self-reflection. It is a direct satire commentary- sending a clear message that we fail to look in the mirrors to see the evil and good inside us, and instead we believe that God will do the good, and that your neighbor or the person across the street is the evil element. It may had made some feel uncomfortable watching this film as well, as it prompts you to take a look in the mirror. One need not take a long, hard look to understand the so-called 'too metaphorical' way in which this film has been done. Yes, there is a metaphor, but its a well done metaphor, not one that is difficult to comprehend or one which is too abstract.Admittedly, the film does have its flaws, editing could have been slicker to say the least, there are parts which simply drag the length beyond much necessity- but here I have to credit Binod Pradhan for capturing the essence of Delhi. The last time I was transported to a location in which a film is based on was in the 2006 Tamil film Paruthi Veeran, which took me to the dry, dusty, vast open village in Madurai, and Delhi 6 follows suit. I was at Chandi Chowk, or to put it simply, I felt like I was transported to Delhi 6 myself with Binod's camera-work capturing everything about the city.Music is certainly great as usual by AR Rahman, but again, Delhi 6 required more silence than noise, thus the entire film was made in a similar way, passive characters- passive, slow music, there's something about the city that is always larger than the people, thats what Rakesh had showed in this film. 'Dil Gira Gaaftan' however, came somewhat needlessly, while 'Kaala Bandar' and 'Gehnda Pool' were shot without much fuss and just relied on Abhi's body language to be pictured, which he certainly did well. Being a Hindu, 'Arziyan' was such a serene listening experience that it became one of my favorite all-time songs, and I was glad the song came repeatedly in the whole film and was an essential backbone to the picture.Some characters could have been developed in more depth, but the assortment of characters, especially those of Boman Irani, Atul Kulkarni, and Om Puri were all interesting to watch and definitely went well with me. Unlike many other viewers, I wasn't expecting typical Bolly romance build up between Abhi and Sonam thus I wasn't disappointed there as well. Sonam is just another assortment along with many other characters, and Roshan happens to fall in love with her- period.And i think she did well enough for the screen time she was given. And the film essentially lacked in showing the 'good people' inside the characters essentially. When Abhi says 'Indian works, the people make it work'- the second part of that phrase is eluded and underdeveloped throughout this film, and this is why I'm taking a star off my rating.8.68/10 I would readily buy a Delhi 6 DVD when it comes out and keep it in my collection. It might be one of the very few films that is heavily criticized by the so-called pros but loved by me. But, heck, I enjoyed it, and I don't mind watching it again and again and again.Yeh Delhi He Mere Yaar, Bas Ishq Mohabbat Pyaar." 
" A movie to understand.","I think the excellent movie till date from abhishek and great movie with great music ....a "GREAT SCRIPT" nd a great acting from everyone... a very nice movie and ll just say that a must watch movie for all Indians.NOT just watch the movie but to understand it deepness hidden in it.just wanna say that m not very good in movie criticizing but if i can understand the movie with it deep thought so that every normal human can also understand. I think more of this theme movie also need to make in Bollywood instead of just crap movie with fighting and no story line just with action in them . request to all to like and support this kind of movie and encourage the director for this kind of masterpieces." 
" Simply Exemplary!!","While modern India races ahead towards its self-designed glory with aspirations and outlook that are based on the premise of something new and different, the majority still lives in stark contrast to these changes. The Indian society in reality is multi-faced with its culture, customs, traditions, orthodox outlook, communal bitterness, corruption and above all, hypocrisy. Delhi 6 is a mirror shown to us that portrays this Indian society in changing times. Now whether one chooses to believe that the image in the mirror is a story-less facade, a mockery or a genuinely vivid portrayal of the Indian kaleidoscope is a matter more of acceptance than of opinion. Rakesh OmPrakash Mehra's 'Aks' was a bold venture into the indestructible evil but his distinct narrative style was incomprehensible by the majority. His next film claimed an iconic status for him and 'Rang De Basanti' became a cult movie with outstanding music, technical finesse, brilliant story telling and a soul stirring message. With 'Delhi 6', Rakesh Mehra gives us a view of his childhood locality in Delhi through the eyes of an NRI who finds the warmth and diversity appeal to him as he brings his ailing grandmother back home. Soon he discovers the hypocrisy and backwardness that lies underneath the surface of the society that first gave him love but now leaves him in disbelief of the reality around him. There is a subtle meaning behind every dialog, a satirical take on every reality, a brilliant visual for everything beautiful, a metaphorical implication for our inner selves in parallel plots, the meaningful and unique compositions of Prasoon Joshi with AR Rehman's genius and a narrative so powerful yet subtle in context and delivery. Rakesh Mehra proves yet again, that he is a class apart from the rest.The narrative is like a rich textured, painfully woven cloth made of fine individual threads of varied colors that exemplify the film's diverse characters. We see Delhi through the eyes of Roshan (Abhishek Bachchan) who shows maturity and greater understanding of the story than simply that of his character. Bittu (Sonam Kapoor-beautiful!) is the concealed modern face of an Indian Idol aspirant whose dreams are caged by her father's orthodox attitude. Waheeda Rehman plays Roshan's grand mom with her natural ability as a veteran actress while she munches on supari, Pan and dances to Genda Phool. Rishi Kapoor is at his charming best as Ali Baig, Roshan's uncle, a reputable citizen of Delhi 6 whose insight into the ways and customs of the society are both didactic and lasting in their impact. Gobar (Atul Kulkarni  class act!), the simpleton who is always ridiculed by everyone has an impactive part to play towards the end while Pawan Malhotra and Om Puri play the roles of acrimonious brothers in a manner that is consistent with their brilliant acting prowess. The list of towering performances extends with Vijay Raaz as the typical corrupt and conceited policeman, Deepak Dobriyal as the rancorous victim of his society's inanity, Prem Chopra as the flamboyant moneylender and Divya Dutta as the outcast trash picker whose mockery of the hypocritical 'clean communities' pinches at the conscience of many. Although the ensemble cast may seem like the film's highlight, it actually is Rakesh Mehra and Prasoon Joshi's script and screenplay that result in the entwined narrative leading to an analogous summation of the story. Running parallel to Roshan's discovery of India and its people is the plot involving the real life incident of Delhi's 'black monkey scare' back in 2001. This Kaala Bandar menace has shaken the very grounds of scientific and logical credibility while leaving the citizens in a fearful state. Who or what really is this Kaala Bandar?? And of what real significance is the symbolic Ramleela play?? The two aspects of the story have a deeper significance in the real message that Rakesh Mehra's nimble direction is trying to convey and is now clearly affirmed as the trademark in all his films. AR Rehman returns in his best form after RDB. Every song bears resemblance to those of RDB's in an inconspicuous manner while remaining distinct and pertinent to Delhi 6's story. Prasoon Joshi gives us unique lyrics yet again that carry the deeper meaning which not all dialogs could convey. Genda Phool is the most imaginative song which has a rapper tune to it in the most Indian form ever heard. Rehna Tu, in true Rehman style is that one song in his album that remains the most melodious with his own voice.Bhor Bhaye and Tumre bhavan main are brilliantly rendered in classical style. Arziyan is a great composition with outstanding voices of Kailash Kher and Javed Ali. Delhi hai is the catchy theme song that shows Rehman's versatility with modern music and Kaala Bandar is like a musical story in itself in hip- hop style. Masakali is beautifully sung by Mohit Chauhan and the composition reminds us of what Gulzar would have written for a pigeon. Overall, Delhi 6 is the album that is a rare gem even by the maestro.'Let us look at the mirror, in which we see a message, in which we see our wronged sides, our true conscience'. Delhi 6 is an honest thought; a philosophy that is truly a reflection of what is around us but which we tend to disregard in our own arrogance or ignorance. The movie's true hero is the crazy Fakir who roams around with a mirror in his hand while narrating the film's enduring philosophy "zarre zarre main usika noor hai, jhaankh khud main, woh Na tujhse door hai.." Rakesh Mehra's film- making embodies sheer brilliance in story telling, running parallel narratives, strong and witty script, superlative screenplay that does equal justice to an ensemble star cast and in the end leaves a deductive message that one can ponder over for quite sometime. Just go watch it.9.29 on a scale of 1-10." 
" Serpent in Eden","Delhi 6 is a beautiful poem full of exquisite metaphors, imagery full of the colours and sounds that only a man in love with a city can come up with.The film is shot with the tender loving care that colours those places where we have been born and raised. The night shots, the shots at dawn, the combined magic of Ram Lila and the crazed faqir who walks around with a mirror beseeching all of us to gaze at our own images to "find" the Creator-- all this is surely the Delhi of Ghalib and Zauq and forgotten classics like Ahmed Ali's "Twilight in Delhi".It is also the Delhi that is now lost to us and completely alien to the new MTV generation."Delhi 6" is one of the many symbols that Mehra plays with in this movie. It is supposed to exemplify an area of the Old City where the composite culture of Delhi with strands of Hinduism and Islam has thrived for centuries, the story of a people who have learnt to live with the unending barrage of subliminal influences brought in by the thousands of invaders who ravaged Delhi again and again.This is why the film is so delightful; it fills that great aching space in one's heart, that space rendered empty once we leave our town, our land in search of greener pastures and lucre abroad, forsaking that inner space where rabid monkeys can come to roost in these troubled times.Hats off to the casting director, the DOP, the lyricist, the actors-- everyone associated with the film and this includes the doves and fantail pigeons.AR Rehman's music is a sign that he is definitely blessed by that divine spark without which any original creation is impossible; Sonam is guileless in her interpretation of Bittu; Abhishek has always been a favourite and he is good; Om Puri, Waheeda Rehman, Divya, everyone (except Cyrus)do a wonderful job. As for Rishi Kapoor, I am ready to fall in love with him again! The film is like warm embrace scented with orange marigolds and exquisite jasmine garlands.However, there is always a serpent in Eden.In this case, the Monkey Man becomes the albatross around Mehra's neck. Having picked up the ultimate symbol of urban hysteria and insecurity, he feels compelled to ditch the subtle symbolism he starts with, to lapse into a level of didacticism that can be called almost pedestrian thus dragging a beautiful eulogy to a place where self righteous critics will find it easy to cast stones. Mehra is a veteran now and should have known better.Even so, this is not a film that you should miss or ignore." 
" Absolutely Amazing!","What a delight! The streets of Delhi haven't ever looked as affable as through the camera of Binod Pradhan in Delhi-6. To be honest, when I had heard the music release, a few songs seemed out-of-place/non-inspiring, but every note played in the movie seems to blend seamlessly with the plot.It's not a perfect movie - the plot seems to be unconvincing in the last 20 minutes, but that doesn't even manage to scrape the lingering happy feeling that you're left with from the previous couple of hours of the movie.I found three remarkable things about the movie. I've already mentioned the cinematography - it makes you wish you were there. Then there is a bunch of the most heartwarming, hilarious scenes written and enacted brilliantly. Yet, the performance by the actors is what remains with you when you step out of the theater. Divya Dutta, Deepak Dobriyal, and Vijay Raaz stand out and have such impact through their few appearances that you end up believing they were on screen for almost the entire movie. Waheeda Rahman and Rishi Kapoor remind us that Old is Gold. In fact, the entire cast is full of life, and has carried the story on its shoulders through every scene. Abhishek Bachhan has done justice to his talent.If you're a fan of the old run-on-the-mill Indian movie, better stay at home. If you wish to see a delightful approach to cinema, go catch the movie.I rate it at 7/10." 
" 9/10","One of the better Hindi movies.....definitely. How rarely do you see a metaphor so beautifully woven in a story that you don't even realize that you are already a part of it. ROM has his way of story-telling and delivering a really good and positive message. Every director should try and be true to their work and script. Cinematography was awesome. Scenes of Kala-bandar roaming the city were very good. Exceptional cast. Great music score.....A.R. Rahman is really a magician. Music sets the mood outright and the lyrics convey a lot. Parallel working of Ram-leela and the story was great. Good character selection....every character is there to say something.....may it be arrogant policewala....untouchable 'jalebi'.....rich 'lalaji'.....or 'gobar'. This movie works beautifully in delivering the message that it wants to convey. A must watch for all movie-lovers...if you don't get it, you don't deserve it." 
" Very highly recommended.","Chandni Chowk can be an awe-inspiring place to be in, not only for its popular eateries and shops which date back to the last century, but also because in essence it represents the quintessential Delhi or more appropriately a "mini India'. For Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra's Delhi-6, this celebrated locality provides an inspiring backdrop to an episodical tale about a handful of characters that are as diverse as the city itself and who represent the one billion population of the Indian republic.Mehra has often insisted that the city of Delhi is a pivotal character in the film rather than being a mere backdrop. He couldn't have been more correct. Old Delhi in particular, where the film is set, is a living symbol of the country's contrasting cultures and beliefs and also a reminder of her rich past epitomized largely by the bygone Mughal era.In Delhi-6, Mehra along with his gifted writers (Prasoon Joshi and Kamlesh Pandey) exploit this fact with panache to present characters that have been handpicked from every corner of the country; who convey a myriad of emotions and actions. These are everyday-characters that you can relate to easily and you may as well see yourself in one of them. The main protagonists of the film are Roshan and Bittu. Roshan (Abhishek Bachchan) is an Indian American visiting India for the first time with his ailing grandmother (Waheeda Rahman). His supposedly short visit to drop his Dadi in Chandni Chowk turns out to be much longer when he embarks on a journey to discover his ancestral country's rich culture, diverse religions, conflicting beliefs and a neighbourhood of distinct individuals including Bittu (Sonam Kapoor) for whom he develops a liking.Bittu on the other hand is a middle-class girl who wants to be independent and make a name for herself by participating in the reality show, Indian Idol, but only to be stopped by her old-fashioned conservative father, Madan Gopal (Om Puri). Other notable characters include that of Jalebi (Divya Dutta) who is considered to be an untouchable in public but at the same time exploited as an object of sexual pleasure in private company; and Inspector Ranvijay (Vijay Raaz), a stubborn and corrupted neighborhood cop who enjoys being the boss wherever he goes.The beast within is very cleverly represented by the Kala Bandar (Monkey Man) who is shown to be creating a menace throughout the city disrupting peace and harmony and is also the cause of many unpleasant events that unfold post-intermission, chiefly that of the divide between Hindus and Muslims. Numerous other small but significant nuances give considerable depth and a deeper meaning to the film; there are two of them which stand out, the symbolic scene where a pregnant cow gives birth to its calf in the middle of a busy road which is considered sacred and the unconditional love that Roshan receives from his neighbors on his arrival in Chandni Chowk despite meeting them for the first time, portraying the fact that even if those people are just normal middle class citizens, they have a big heart and they lead a content and happy life by spreading love around them. The latter is synonymous with what Delhi is popularly known to be – "Dilwalon ki Dilli".Providing ample support as the film's protagonists are the two leads, Abhishek Bachchan and Sonam Kapoor. Sonam's stunning debut in Saawariya was only a small glimpse of her acting prowess. She has evolved into a very fine actor with Delhi-6 and apart from looking more beautiful than ever, she delivers a very dignified performance. Unlike in her debut vehicle, she has dealt with a more diverse set of emotions in this film, from being cheerful to expressing rebellion and anger. Abhishek Bachchan does not have too many lines to say but he uses that silence to his advantage, combines it with brilliant expressions and gestures, and lights up every frame he occupies. Given the right character and director, this often underrated actor can do wonders.Binod Pradhan's cinematography is best termed as intimate. It is evident from the film's stunning visuals that he loves every corner of the walled city and with his long-proved expertise with the camera, he gives shape to the director's vision flawlessly, never once going over the top and maintaining perfect balance between depth and clarity. The Jama Masjid, Ram Leela and the climax have been especially well shot. Dialogues are effective throughout and thought-provoking at times. Editing by P.S. Bharthi is very well done which limits the film's length to an acceptable 2 hours 18 minutes running time.Also laudable are the production design by Samir Chanda and appealing choreography (Masakali, Genda Phool) by Vaibhavi Merchant. Dil Gira Dafatan has been innovatively choreographed where the characters from Chandni Chowk, even the actors from the Ram Leela, are transported to New York's Times Square. Although the purpose of this fantasized sequence may only be clear to the discerning audience, it still looks appealing enough to please anyone and everyone.Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra had shot two contrasting versions of the film's ending and if you have been an ardent follower of Mehra's previous films, then the finale of Delhi-6, in which Mehra has tried to play safe, may surprise you which will quite likely be met with differences in opinions. Nevertheless, Delhi-6 is an unforgettable cinematic experience. A universal film in all respects, connoisseurs of good cinema will lap it up whole heartedly. It is that rare gem of a film that will be remembered and discussed for many more years to come.I go with 8* Stars. Very highly recommended." 
" The beauty of the film lies in how artsy cinema has been blended so","A bit late given the fact that I had been for the film the night it released i.e. the 20th of February. So better late than never I am finally writing a review which I had been thinking of working on since the past one month. But as the saying goes, better late than never so here I am finally giving my review of the film  Delhi 6, a film which has been described by Rajeev Masand as a film with a heart. The film basically deals with Roshan's (Abhishek Bachchan) journey from New York to one of the more chaotic areas of the country  Chandni Chowk whose pin code stands as '6' and it is from here the title of the film comes from.The film has a beautiful narrative wherein it is the leading protagonist who has a voice-over and tells the story. The story begins wherein Roshan cannot relate Chandni Chowk here is also symbolic of an average Indian residential community which has shades of real life characters  a corrupt policeman, egoist brothers who can't stand each other, the mohalla idiot. Simple scenes like  Hindus and Muslims worshipping not just their own religious Gods but vice versa, the distribution of Prasad from both the mosque and the temple enjoyed by the mohallawalas, Roshan made to talk on the phone even at a time when he is waiting outside the rest room in very urgent state, the Muslims youth having a secret hideout where the practice all the material things like drinking or playing pool which is restricted by their religion, a Muslim tying devi maa ka kapda on the hands of Roshan's grandmother down with a medical emergency, at the same time the scene of a cow giving birth to a calf on the middle of the street which cures the ailing grandmother and also re emphasizes that faith heals but my favourite of them remains the scene showing the image of Hanuman and Haj sharing the same wall in a Muslim shop which reasserts the uniqueness of Indian Muslims in a time when more and more Muslims from India are being influenced by jehadi ideas.The beauty of the film lies in how artsy cinema has been blended so well with mainstream cinema. As ROM had rightly put it that if RDB was his passing out of school, D6 is his graduation. And is very true in what he means. There is a big stress on symbolisms  Masakali, the dove stands the individual's curtailed right to freedom and being tied down by restrictions, the Ram leela and relevance of its chapters is time and again reflected whether it is the Shabari episode being shown as the same time wherein caste based discrimination exists in the audience or be it the burning o f Ravana symbolizing victory over external evil and last but not least Kaala Bandar which reflects the evil within which we have to see and correct by looking at the mirror.The actors have perfectly fitted in the shoes of their characters - Abhishek Bachchan, Rishi Kapoor, Sonam Kapoor, Vijay Raaz, Pawan Malhotra, Om Puri, Divya Dutta and all the other so called supporting actors have come up with some splendid performances of their lifetimes. A R Rehman has done a fabulous job as usual by blending the songs perfectly as per the requirements of the screenplay and by no means do look forcefully pushed into it.The feel good emotion which the film carries with it is impressive summed in the dialogue "India works. The people make it work". The only disappointment was the final guest entry as it looked very much forced up and really did not fit in the entire screenplay. But the overall goodness of the film overcomes this ignorable aspect. Delhi 6 is taking Indian cinema to a much higher level breaking away from the typical so called "filmy singing around the trees kind of story". A realistic story on reel Delhi 6 is an effort which should be appreciated and will go down in the books as a milestone film in the league of Swades, Rang De Basanti, and many more. And yes, last but not least do not leave the theatres before the credits at the end of the film as it really is a wrap-up on the film as a whole and you don't want to miss that." 
" Entertainment at its best...","Delhi-6 is a well made movie by Mr.Rakesh Omprakash Mehra.We saw his first movie Aks then came Rang De Basanti which coloured the country in its colour and now we have Delhi-6 a movie made with Dil(Heart) like Delhites..Movie is a bit slow in first 20 mins but then Mr. Mehra gradually gains pace and steals the show..He is one of the finest directors we have in our country and he tries to fill in a message into his films..This time he chooses Kala Bandar(Black Monkey)..There was a big scare of kala bandar in delhi in the year 2001 and the director makes full use of the controversy created and ends up giving a beautiful message to us.. Abhishek has matured as an actor and he pulls off the role of Roshan effortlessly..One of the major attraction of the movie is bittoo(Sonam Kapoor)..She is the cute girl from chandni chowk and she looks very very beautiful in the movie and she has played her characted very well..All in all a great movie with a lovely message..Must Watch!!" 
" A Nutshell Review: Delhi 6","Abhishek Bachchan's character Roshan made a remark relatively early in the movie that made me laugh out loud. While watching a stage play, and not totally well versed in the history nor story, he commented that it was the one about a "golden deer", and to a certain extent, it was true, but of course totally taken out of context. It reminded me of a personal anecdote many years ago, where a Caucasian couple was standing next to me and watching a lion dance performance. Not knowing what they were, the wife asked the husband, who proudly replied "They're dogs, but they're good dogs!". I was chuckling too hard inside to want to enlighten them.And personal stories of life is what Delhi 6 contains, being reportedly somewhat semi- autobiographical of director-co-writer Rakesh Omprakash Mehra's growing up years in Delhi. The film is set against the backdrop of Old Delhi with the postal code of 110006, hence the title, and for the wide-eyed boy like me who has never been to India (yet), it's quite an eye opener that the film captures plenty of the sights, sounds, food and you can imagine the smells, as seen through the eyes of Abhishek's Roshan.An American citizen, he volunteers to accompany his aged grandmother (Waheeda Rehman) back to her hometown in Delhi 6 out of duty and curiosity as to hie ancestry, and for the first half, he's floored by plenty of new experiences formed from interaction with his extended family and friends of his parents and grandparents. From starting out wondering why his grandmother would want to pass away in Delhi 6, he soon realizes that it's the community spirit that is so strong within the town, that he too fell head over heels with it. And of course, getting to know the neighbouring beauty Bittu (Sonam Kapoor) helped too, even though it got off the wrong footing to begin with.This is Rakesh Omprakash Mehra's ode to Old Delhi, filled with plenty of montage, with special effects no less, squeezing all things memorable that he had to say and pay homage to, on all things quirky like the community stage plays, superstition and rites, and down to the negatives like the rampant corruption of those in uniform, as well as the inane media news reporting and the caste issue, as seen through the eyes of an NRI - Non Resident Indian.While the first half may be more touristy in spirit, with the filmmakers opting to showcase plenty of romanticized shots of streets and everyday life courtesy of Roshan's Motorola mobile phone, the tone of the film got more serious after the intermission, exploring base feelings, primal instincts and intolerant mob mentality coupled with sectarian violence. From the onset there's a kind of supernatural/mystery feel to the narrative with the strange hypothesis and theories of a "Black Monkey" being in the midst of and terrorizing residents, and surprisingly I actually appreciated how this angle was eventually treated and wrapped.Sonam Kapoor had her debut in the feature Saawariya which I had enjoyed but unfortunately many didn't and the film tanked at the box office. While Saawariya co-star Ranbir Kapoor had already gone on to make his second film Bachna Ae Haseeno released last year, Delhi 6 marks the second film for Sonam, and I felt that while the role here didn't give her many opportunities to shine, given that it's the usual small town girl with big dreams, and very much more modern than the culture and tradition she is brought up in, again she lights up the screen with plenty of genuine vivaciousness that it actually became quite infectious for you not to fall in love with the character. Like the pet dove, her Bittu too has her wings clipped and tied by the father, preventing her from soaring to fulfill her dreams of becoming an Indian Idol. John Woo would've wondered why he didn't think of a dove-inspired dance!While Sonam Kapoor was the first choice as the lead actress, surprisingly the lead actor role was bounced around and rejected by many, before Abhishek Bachchan gave the nod. I thought he brought out the role of Roshan quite convincingly, and his ability to single- handedly journey the viewer and navigate the new land was never doubted, bringing his big town tendencies to a small town he doesn't quite understand. And as bonus, no prizes for who was featured as an additional lending of gravitas to the film.I particularly liked how the film inserted many plot devices and elements which were addressed and closed for the most parts, albeit some being done in quite an abrupt manner, such as how the grandmother's intent in the first half got forgotten immediately after the intermission. It did feel quite rushed toward the finale, but all is forgiven for the presence of A.R. Rahman's music. Again he provides some majestic tunes to highlight the key moments in the film, and while I had enjoyed every single one of it, one that I truly liked best was Makahali, which in the film was the name of the clipped dove. It had this really catchy tune that sticks, and picturized very effectively in the film, bringing out emotions of the moment wonderfully.Delhi 6 preaches (yes it did feel that way, for the lack of time and very obvious ranting in the last act) about community, how as one people standing united with love for one another, that despite the frequent chaos, no obstacle cannot be overcome. But this balance is ever fragile, and it takes so little of a catalyst of fearing the unknown and unfounded superstition and suspicion to break it all down for the worst. It's a lesson for all of us, to open our minds and not fall prey to negative emotions, especially those that cause more harm to the greater good." 
" Excellent show.","I went to see this movie with high expectations, from the director Rakesh Mehra who has given us 'Rang De Basanti', from the subject i.e. the heart of old Delhi and also because of the mixed reviews the movie had received. The movie turned out to be a good movie, but It failed to impress and there were so many places where it could have done much better. Acting-wise the performances were mixed, with supporting cast (i.e. Delhi 6 Residents) doing the 'natural' act which was good. Cyrus Sahukar was OK. Divya Dutta and Vijay Raaz were great. Rishi Kapoor was just average. Waheeda Rahman disappointed. Abhishek Bachhan tried to do his best and the NRI touch given to his accent was good, we can't expect better from him. Sonam Kapoor's role was of being cute which she did perfectly. Some of the actors were under-used. Overall performances by the whole cast was very good. Some of the sequences were unnecessary which could be avoided, like the one where Abhishek has a chat with big B, or the one in which he tries to give some speech, or the one where he has a dream about having the Delhi 6 on the streets of America. The dialogs at some places were not so good, mainly in the second half where the director decides to give a message through the film, but hey Mr. Mehra its always a bad idea to have you message delivered in the form of a speech by the protagonist. Try to weave it into the story as you did with RDB. The Kala Bandar theme of the movie could have been over-used, but he was able to justify it.The song were great with very good music from Rahman(Totally deserves the double Oscar win), and Lyrics written by Prasoon Joshi was totally in rhythm with the theme of the film, especially the song Kala Bandar. But apart from the songs the background score failed to impress and sucked big time at places.Overall the film is a must watch and if you like it you'll just love it when you see it the second time.I'll give it 9 out of 10.PS: On the second watch, I was just unable to find any flaws in the story telling. Great film guys. Though it is a bit different, but once you get to understand it, all the pieces seem to be perfect." 
" one of the best movie of the decade","An Indian-American, Roshan brings his dying grandmother from America back to her house in old Delhi. This is presumably his first trip to his ancestral city.Roshan has an awkward accent and a tendency to describe things as cool but other than that he blends in quite easily into this colourful, crowded world of Ram Leelas, roadside jalebi stalls, narrow lanes and cows who stop traffic by giving birth on the street. There is little culture shock, bewilderment or impatience.In director Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra's vision of Chandni Chowk, which incidentally was recreated on a set in Rajasthan, there aren't any flies, heat or grime either. There aren't even any crows. Instead, Old Delhi is inhabited by beautiful white doves, including Massakali, who inspires a lovely song.The first half is a loose, impressionistic portrait of this world. There is very little plot. In between vignettes establishing characters, we have repeated references to a Monkey Man who is terrorising Delhi.This is taken from actual incidents in 2001 when Delhi was afflicted by a monkey man menace, which the police later dismissed as public hysteria.In the second half, these various threads come together climaxing in a Hindu-Muslim confrontation, which turns violent. Ultimately the residents see the light only because of the not so subtly named Roshan.This lack of subtlety is what ultimately undoes Delhi 6. Mehra is an astute and passionate filmmaker who has never been afraid of big themes. But while in Rang De Basanti, he weaved the narrative beautifully with the message, Delhi 6 has the finesse of a sledge-hammer.The film asks you to look within so there is an actual character, a sort of Shakespearean fool, who walks around carrying a mirror, asking people to literally look within.In the climatic violence, the mirror is shattered. The climax itself feels unearned. The script barely hints at the tensions simmering below the bonhomie on the streets. There are some beautifully done moments  one that brought tears to my eyes has the grandmother asking her grandson to take her home because after a communal confrontation, she says, she doesn't even feel like dying there.But there are just as many moments that feel so laboured and sanctimonious that you just want to groan.Mehra's heart is in the right place but he is hobbled by his own script and platitudinous dialogue like  "India works, the people make it work".The film brims with talented actors but they don't have enough meat to bite into. Roshan, the prime mover of events, is under-written so Abhishek comes off as an earnest NRI with a bad accent and little sub-text.Bittu has more flesh on her and the lovely Sonam imbues her with grace and attitude. There are flashes of fire in some scenes with Rishi Kapoor and Waheeda Rahman but not enough to light up Delhi 6.Ultimately then, the film is a noble failure. Delhi 6 is ambitious and well-intentioned, but good intentions don't always translate into good cinema. Must Watch truly Indian movie."
