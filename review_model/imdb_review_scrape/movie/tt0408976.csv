" Baseless thriller","Looks like Ekta Kapoor produces another not-that-great thriller and also uses the same locales.  A good thriller usually does have the shocking moments that make you jump in your seat, and this movie "kind of" has some of those, but you have no idea who/what is scaring everyone.  Is it a ghost? Is it a murderer? Is it a victim?  Nothing seems to make sense. Pointless scaring is not scary at all.  The story finally makes sense towards the end, but it's too late by then.  Some rather unconvincing scenes are more comical than they are scary.  Rati Agnihotri is a good actress, but her ghost scene is absolutely hilarious.  Songs are okay.  Sohail and Isha gave a decent performance." 
" A good horror film","Balaji films attempted a horror/ thriller/romance in 2003 in KUCCH TO HAI but result was indeed horrible...in 2004 they came up with a horror film KRISHNA COTTAGE but this time this film actually delivered ..
On the story font it is about a bunch of college going friends who somehow came to know a secret (one by one) about their latest friend (!) And this causes them being murdered one by one...who is this new friend? What is the secret? Why it is taking lives? What is the role of KRISHNA COTTAGE? Who is the ghost/ spirit?....all these are answered and it is mostly satisfying.
Now horror elements are definitely there...it is expected to give you some scares ... Don't expect too much either...
Acting wise nothing historical type but the bunch of actors in this film are not known for their acting ....Sohail Khan doesn't fit into a college student role but he acts okay...Anita looked little uneasy at times but maintain to hold her role ...Isha koppikar was good ...rest of actors are okay
Overall if you like horror films and that too in the midst of college campus type ...this should be on your watch list..." 
" Sohail and Natassha look good together","I liked the "Bindas" song. Sohail Khan and Natassha had good chemistry. Sohail's character was sensitive to Isha's character another plus point regarding the film. Overall the film was good and I like the TV serials of the production company (Koi Apna Sa was my favorite on ZEE, although I never had a opportunity to watch every single episode!)The promos of "Aryan" look good. Sneha is definitely a new face to watch out for...I still have to watch "Lucky". From the advertising of "Aryan" she has potential and can play a teenager which most actresses cannot. Aryan is another summer movie I am looking forward to besides the "DaVinci Code". Getting back to this picture, my favorite memory is the "Bindas" song, a very catchy, hummable sing-along-with type tune. Everyone should watch the movie and enjoy the fun filled song.The acting is good considering most of the actors are young. Rati is a fantastic actress, I remember watching her films as a young girl. I am glad she is back! I am partial to thrillers...most of the Hollywood movies I like watching are of the suspense/horror/psychological thriller variety. I have so much catching up to do as far as Hindi films are concerned. I need to make a list and stick to it. So many foreign movies, so little time."
