" If nothing, the movie is worth for the Irfan Khan & the music","Father-Daughter Bhatt have embarked on a mission to ensure Film-Noir is a set genre for Bollywood audience. Jism, Murder and a few other movies of theirs are adaptations of Hollywood movies from years ago. ROG is one of the better movies they have produced, and most of it's credit goes to a brilliant performance by Irfan Khan. I am not exaggerating when I say he is the worthy successor to Naseeruddin Shah in the ease with which he slips into any role he portrays. This movie follows the murder investigation of a beautiful model, Maya Solomon, by 'super-cop' Inspector Uday Rathore (Khan) who suffers from mild-insomnia. While conducting the investigation and piecing together the past of the model, the cop starts falling in love with the image of the dead woman; all the while trying to find her killer. With a cast of a few extras (including a loud 'accented' confused-desi), none of the other performances are worth note. Yet, the movie itself is well made (a proper script, whoa!) with a beautiful score (M.M Kreem) and a brilliant lead performance. The twists (save one) are a little predictable, but the presentation is a revelation for a low-budget Indian movie. Kudos to the director Himanshu Brahmbhatt for a job well done (he is Mahesh Bhatt's AD from the Gumrah & Sadak). If nothing, the movie is worth for the Irfan Khan alone. I have set myself up to watch any movie this man stars in. Oh, and the music is awesome.My Rating ---> 2.5 of 5 Trivia: * Irfan Khan is the same titular 'The Warrior' from Asif Kapadia's epic English movie (which I thought was very slow). * M M Kreem insists on proper poets to pen lyrics for his songs, else he doesn't compose music. (Never expect a 'David Dhawan' song from him). * This movie is a remake of Laura (1944)" 
" One more erotic thriller movie after Jism and Inteqaam","ROG produced by Pooja Bhatt who tasted her first success as a producer with Jism, so she thought to go ahead with such kind of genre and taste the success again but sorry Pooja this time you went wrong as you went wrong with your directorial debut movie Paap where you promoted it as a Sex Movie Jism Part 2 which it was not and because of this reason it was rejected by the audience. Rog was screened last year in Pakistan at Kara Film Festival and Paap was also screened in 2003.The film is about Ilene Hamann around whom the story of 'Rog' moves. She heads for an ad man Suhel Seth and soon their life flow peacefully. But, the silence turns deadly when one day she is found dead.Then the story takes the turn that who has done this? What was the motive behind this brutal act against a woman? And, it is here when the investigating officer Irfaan Khan enters the scene. First he considers it as a usual crime case, but soon realizes that it is not as simple. Hamann's daydream makes him fanatical. Is he sick? But, this is only the start of the confusion that he is going to lead into.What could have been an edge-of-the-seat thriller loses focus soon after the principal characters are introduced. The climax is insensible that whatever shocks a few sequences created just disappear. Even the identity of the murderer does not come as a shock.The worst writing by Mahesh Bhatt, bad direction by Himashu Brambhatt and also not good cinematography by Anshuman Mahaley. 1 out of 5" 
" Thanks, but no thanks","One of the earliest-released films of 2005, it tried to cash in early on the country's new-found craving for 'Chamdi' (flesh).Written by Mahesh Bhatt, it was directed by Himanshu Brahmbhatt (who?) and produced by Puja Bhatt. Looks like the entire extended Bhatt family -- Chacha-Chachi, Mama-Mami, Dada-Nani, Mausi, Padosi AND Bhatiji, were involved in SOME way or another with this project.So what was the finished product like? Oh my god, don't ask (tsk tsk). Such a fine talent, no? So all wasted no? They thought as long as Apri Pooja Ni Phillum Chhe, Su Chhe, Saru Chhe, Badha Maja-Maa Mast Chhe!!Except for M M Kreem's music, there is nothing worth mentioning about this sorry skin flick. Watch only if there's nothing else to do." 
" An excellent acting! Irfan rocks!!!! Nothing else to see!","I never ever noticed Irfan until I saw this movie! I knew him for his voice and now I know him for his acting! He is brilliant, he really rocks, all u see is Irfan. However, everything else is same like other Indian movie. There is good suspense thought. You will surely love this movie with pint of beer on your sofa and at good wet evening with rain !! As all know he is one of the best unnoticed actor in Indian cinema this time he came with some good show off!I am sure you will enjoy this movie as long as you like Irfan and you ignore some aspects of movie!Have a pint of beer and enjoy Irfan! If Irfan is reading this comment by any chance, let me tell you that you are one of the best one we have~!" 
" Nice, fresh film","I thought this was a nice, fresh movie to ring in 2005. Irfaan Khan acted brilliantly. He played his role of a depressed cop who has no desire to live very convincingly. The actress, however, was quite lame. She is portrayed as drop-dead gorgeous, heavenly, and very innocent. I thought she was the complete opposite--she seemed kind of ugly and quite worldly. Nevertheless, the story and characters are quite interesting. Pooja Bhatt always has a thing for creating extremely mysterious characters that strike the audience's curiosity as they do in Rog. The actress's friend, boyfriend, etc. all have interesting personalities. The very idea of falling in love with a dead person is indeed very haunting, and it is disturbing to think of love as a disease as the tag line suggests. There are some really nice scenes and dialogs. Songs are excellent, especially Guzar Na Jaaye." 
" Awful","I watched this film with high hopes and as a big fan of Irrfan Khan, but am afraid to say that this is the biggest pile of garbage I have seen in a long while and feel that I have been robbed of my time.The plot line is an outrageous, piecemeal, predictable mess, which left me feeling unfulfilled and irritable. The sound was equally awful and had me thinking back to viewings of the stunningly bad 'Fun 2 Shh: Dudes in the 10th Century'. The score was disjointed and out of place, not my cup of tea at all.The only saving grace was Irrfan Khan, who's exquisite acting skills were unfortunately eclipsed by the truly dreadful writing and direction. All in all, worth a look if this is your sort of thing, but for me this is one of the worst films out of India in 2005. Abysmal." 
" Good music & irrfan.!!","Just ain't the movie is good! It is so well written and on that so Sir Irfan awesomely acted upon it! STANDING OVATION - to the dialogues, script, acting, and it's songs as well !" 
" An honest thriller. Should be watched for Irfan Khan's Acting, great dialogues and gripping suspense","Where to start. It is one my favourite sunday afternoon movie, where I want to see some passionate cinema with deep philosophical dialogues. Just watch the first scene of the movie and you will be hooked.According to credits, movie is written by Mahesh Bhatt and is loosely based on Hollywood movie Laura (which I have not seen). The movie is among those Indian movies which feature normal everyday language dialogues with deeper meanings, which is found otherwise in Anurag Kashyap cinema. It has real life-like grey characters instead of mythological Ram or Ravan characters, out of which majority of Indian cinema is composed of.The actress Ilene Hamann (Maya) has done the job given to her. She is supposed to be beautiful, mysterious and mesmerizing. She does all the three jobs beautifully.
 
Some of the dialogues in this movie are outstanding which are rarely seen in Indian cinema. Suhel Seth (Harsh) is an irritating character (to me), though it might be a deliberate characterization.Irfan Khan (Inspector Uday Rathore) has played his role excellently where he is shown as a depressed policeman falling for a woman who he has seen only in a picture. The chemistry between Irfan and Illene is outstanding depicting two lonely souls finding solace in purity of their affection. I wanted to see more scenes of main lead couple, but alas, it's not a romantic movie.Munish Makhija has played his part well as assistant and friend of Irfan. He should be in more movies.Another outstanding feature of the movie is its music by M.M. Kareem. KK and Udit narayan are marvellous in 'Maine Dil se kaha' and 'Khoobsoorat', both of which are written by Nilesh Mishra. Lyrics of these songs beautifully describe the intended meaning and situation in the story, which used to be a feature in old movies but is absent nowadays and already readymade songs being fitted into situations.
Overall you should see the movie for Irfan Khan's Acting, some great dialogues, gripping suspense and Ilene's mesmerizing beauty."
