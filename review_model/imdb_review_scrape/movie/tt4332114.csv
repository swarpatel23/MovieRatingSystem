" The runaway bride","Dolly Ki Doli had an simple yet interesting premise. A con-woman Dolly (Sonam Kapoor) entraps and marries men only to run away with all valuables of the groom and his family. To setup and arrange these fake marriage she has a whole fake family along with her. Sonu (Rajkummar Rao) a jatt farmer who seems to be truly in love with her becomes one such victim. Then after an item number and couple of more fake marriages later is the turn of Manjot (Varun Sharma). There is very less light shed on why this con gang pull-of so many heists yet live a mediocre life. The characters seemed to have zero motivation towards whatever they were doing. Anyways, not all is well when finally after dozens of fake marriages the police comes to know about the gang and a cop (Pulkit Samrat) decides to take up the case because of a some evident personal reason. After few months thanks to Saif Ali Khan's cameo character, when the cop and the bride finally meet face-to- face we have all the clichéd melodrama and even more illogicality with the ending than what had already been portrayed. Anyways its always hard to pull of a credible ending for such con comedy premises.On the positive side, Dolly Ki Doli is briskly based, it just flies off from the word go. Some times the editing felt too choppy but I will appreciate them for keeping it under 100 minutes. This is the basic thing most Bollywood films fail to get right and have overblown run time with very little substance. Debut director Abhishek Dogra keeps the atmosphere light, not to be taken seriously and even satirical at times until the last act. The script is full of illogical behaviors and plot holes, but if you can ignore that then the comedy might be enjoyable. But I myself did not find it hilarious. The comic timing was terrible plus the characters were interesting yet poorly written. Acting wise, all three males Rajkummar,Varun and Pulkit do a commendable job. Sonam Kapoor on the other hand was quite unbearable. Her acting was okayish, but it was the character of Dolly which was utter nonsense. The same old innocent-pretty girl is terribly overdone which made her look annoying plus it is highly unbelievable that so many men fell into her trap so easily. Also we annoying songs and an item number stuffed in just for the sake of it, which had nothing new. Overall, I will say Dolly Ki Doli is a nice and non-formulaic attempt which is appreciable. But it is heavily flawed and has poor dialogues. This ride can be moderately enjoyable only if don't care much about the characters and keep your brains at home. Still, it is highly avoidable.RATING: [1.5/5]" 
" Mediocre!","'Dolly Ki Doli' is a Mediocre film, that's not high on pluses. Its an off-repeated tale, with not much newness or entertainment working on its favor. 'Dolly Ki Doli' Synopsis: Dolly marries men of different religion for their wealth. Until...A Cop gets on her trial. 'Dolly Ki Doli' at a crisp 100-minutes, has a breezy first-hour, but a soulless second. The "supposed" twist in the tale & the reason behind the protagonist's continuous conning, comes across as under-developed. The impact is missing!Abhishek Dogra's Screenplay has a few moments, but overall, is plain mediocre. There's not a single new element in the Screenplay, which deserves a mention. Dogra's Direction is fine. Cinematotaphy & Editing are credible.Performance-Wise: Sonam Kapoor is strictly okay. Despite being the protagonist, the actress doesn't perform up-to the mark. Rajkummar Rao is the silver lining of 'Dolly Ki Doli'. He's absolutely brilliant as the Jatt from Haryana. Varun Sharma is a cartoon, while Pulkit Samrat has a Salman Khan hang-up. Archana Puran Singh is hilarious in a bit role. Manoj Joshi & Brijendra Kala are dependable, as ever. Saif Ali Khan is stiff in a cameo.On the whole, 'Dolly Ki Dolly' is, at best, an ordinary fare." 
" Dolly Is An Annoying Bride. ♦ 34%","I like comedies about social issues; the reason I count myself among the few people who liked Daawat-E-Ishq's (2014) story. Dolly Ki Doli, as it turns out, is a mixture of that film + the female version of Ladies Vs. Ricky Bahl (2012) + Hollywood rom-com Runaway Bride.The story about a petty girl who teams up with crooks to form a family and cheat well off grooms and their families is appealing. The screenplay starts off rather gaudily, slipping in the item song by the sexy Malaika Arora in the first fifteen minutes. There is no background on how and what and why Dolly (Sonam Kapoor) and her fake family are doing what they are doing. Not even the proceedings throw light into the origin. Of course, there is some silly philosophical babble that explains Dolly's immoral profession at the end, but it doesn't make sense.There are few comedic sequences that jeers at issues like arranged marriages in India, auspicious post-wedding first-nights, traditions, dowry customs, etc., but they all fade into nothingness. The final twenty minutes are the worst I have seen in any movie in the past months and that includes Bhushan Patel's torturous, concocted dish Alone (2015).Even if one sustains the tedious first half, nothing will stop you from wondering whether the writers really put in any effort to end this drama rather ceremoniously. There is nothing to talk about the filmmaking parameters, except that Sonam Kapoor cannot act. I have brought up this issue in many (all) of my reviews of her films that Kapoor is just not the chip off the old block. She should shift to catering, or even better: miming in a park in Bandra.The supporting cast (Rao and Samrat, too) adds humor and ounces of glory to the film while Kapoor is busy dancing in at least four songs that I happen to notice. BOTTOM LINE: If I were a 27 year old lad with a job and no girlfriend looking for a getaway this weekend, I would skip Dolly Ki Doli. I would even skip that pretentious Baby (2015) and Depp's career suicide Mortdecai (2015). Instead, I would go to a beach and watch the sun go down the horizon and induce pleasure from it. 3/10.Can be watched with a typical Indian family? YES" 
" Dolly Ki Doli is an honest attempt at a clean, fun film","Dolly Ki Doli's premise is simple and it has been executed with a sharp knife. No room for any flab. The director has a strong control over the narrative- the story moves at a pace that keeps one glued. It does not pretend to be two steps ahead of the viewer, instead it bobs along with him– just a little bit teasingly ahead. This makes the film viewing friendly and attractive.The ensemble cast is another high point- great actors and super performances. Casting is indeed very very apt. Technically the film neither under nor overwhelms you. It works like a smooth ride.Just like the telling of the film, Dolly is a woman with no pretensions. She and the film stand tall. Dolly as the person does not relent right till the climax when all heroes undergo transformation. The film, however, promises the transformation yet keeps the climax refreshing- its other beauty being its non-verbosity. Crisp and bang on. It does leave space for a sequel and that would be something to watch out for.Overall, DKD is an honest attempt at a simple, crisp story telling with a smooth screenplay, some smart dialogs, a lovely cast and equally great performances." 
" Movie not worth watching","The promotion of the movie was better than the actual movie.... the plot of the movie had no sense at all.... the script had no potential at all.... watching this movie is a waste of time and also money. Basically the storyline was the same throughout the movie and felt nothing but a drag....Promotion was carried out like if the movie had an awesome story with much potential to do great business in the cinema but as i can see after watching this, it will only be a one off movie. Moral of the story was stick to the things you can do better and that is all you can do .... for example if your a thief, you stick to that job that's the only thing your good at... therefore you cannot turn around your life and become a better person.. what on earth is she trying to portray... this movie is a total waste of time.." 
" It' not as bad as the critics are saying","This movie shares similarity between Daawat-e-Ishq and Ladies vs Ricky Bahl. In the movie, Sonam Kapoor and her accomplishes arrange fake weddings and robs the potential in-laws of everything. Apparently despite pulling off dozens of this fake weddings no one has a decent picture of the bride or her team. Although the movie tries to explain this obvious flaw by mentioning that the photographer is also part of the scam. Unfortunately this is a dumb explanation as everyone these day walks around with a camera. The movie could've solve this problem by setting it in the late 90's when digital camera and smart-phone boom was still a few years to come. Also I would've preferred the scammers targeting rich families in rural areas. That way the news of bride robbing families wouldn't make much national news. I also find it hard to believe that not one of her would be robbed husband got on any bases with Sonam Kapoor. I don't care what excuse is given by my hot wife, I am getting at least a kiss on my wedding night.The ending is also pretty boring. Apparently the reason sweet and innocent looking Sonam Kapoor becomes bandit queen is because she had her heart broken by the love of her life. I mean COME ON. That's just lazy writing. The songs are pretty boring too. The director should really stop putting his wife in every item song of his movies.This movie deserve a one time watch. Despite its long list of flaws, it's still a much better affair than R..Rajkumar, Action Jackson and Tevar." 
" Amazing movie","Don't go with the rating.
Watch and decide by yourself" 
" Dolly Ki Doli Review","'Dolly Ki Doli' is the first Bollywood movie that I watched in 2015 and it certainly surpassed my expectations. Directed and co-written by Abhishek Dogra, the film has a run time of 98 minutes which is just right considering the quite simple story. Starring Sonam Kapoor, Pulkit Samrat, Rajkumar Rao and Varun Sharma, 'Dolly Ki Doli' is about a runaway bride who tricks various men into getting married to her then runs away with whatever valuables she can steal. The narrative is very linear yet so entertaining containing a relevant flashback explaining why Dolly (Sonam Kapoor) started doing what she does best which is conning people.Sonam Kapoor as a con woman plays her usual typecast 'loud urban chick' role perfectly sporting different looks throughout the film. Her costumes are also spot on glamorising every wedding scene making them look royal especially in the dance number 'Phatte Tak Nachna'. You feel sorry for Sonu (Rajkumar Rao) who the film starts off with. He plays a Haryanvi character so realistically and uses his method acting to showcase a range of emotions.Varun Sharma uses his comedic talent well after 'Fukrey' as a rich spoilt kid who has to go against his mother played by Archana Puran Singh just to marry Dolly. Last of all, Pulkit Samrat plays a Dabangg inspired cop called 'Robin Singh' who takes on the case of finding and nabbing Dolly and her so-called 'family'. There is not much to say about his acting as he was seen in a similar role in last year's 'Jai Ho' except he shows much more charisma in this outing. The stand out performance for me has to be Rajkumar Rao due to his natural performance.Moving on from the positives, although the first half is very entertaining as the story travels at an appropriate pace, the second half seems a bit rushed and the ending is typical. The one question you will be asking is how there were no pictures taken of Dolly at any of the dozen weddings, even though it is revealed that the camera man is a part of their team but surely people carry mobile phones around in this era? However, it doesn't ruin the experience at all as the back story of Dolly will keep you hooked as well as a cameo appearance by none other than Saif Ali Khan. The soundtrack is also decent with mainly dance numbers, one featuring item queen Malaika Arora Khan but the picturisation of 'Mere Naina Kafir Hogaye' stands out due to the emotional quotient attached to it.Overall, the film is quite enjoyable for a January release and certainly a must watch for Sonam Kapoor fans as she brings her quirkiness to the table once again after last year's hit 'Khoobsurat'. The performances by the male leads should also not be underestimated. If you want a serious film like 'Baby' or 'Badlapur', then this definitely isn't for you. However, if you want pure entertainment backed by a decent cast, then go for it." 
" Looteri Dulhaan meri pasia kahan hai? Joking not that bad its time pass entertainment","Dolly (sonam) is a pretty girl who has a brother Raju (zeeshan) whose job is to pick out prospective grooms. In reality, Raju is a fake brother and the plan is Dolly will make these grooms fall in love with her and on the first night, she would drug the groom and her entire gang will loot the house. In this process, Sonu (rajkummar rao) and Manjot (varun sharma) become victims. The task to apprehend Dolly is given to the tough cop Robin Singh (pulkit). Whether he is successful in catching her or not forms the rest.The director has come up with an entertaining storyline and while the presentation was average, the narrative was okay in parts. The dialogues were good. The script was predictable and the screenplay was neat. The background score was melodious and three songs were worth watching. Cinematography was the main strength to this film. Editing was required at few places. Costumes were well designed while the art department was colorful. Sonam Kapoor was her energetic and bubbly self and she did well. Rajkummar Rao was great, Varun Sharma was versatile, Pulkit Samrat made his presence felt. Zeeshan was entertaining, Rajesh Sharma was impressive, Malaika sizzles with her song, Manoj Joshi was moderate. Brijender Kala was good:Others didn't get much scope.From the looks of it, you get reminded of the Hollywood movie 'The Runaway Bride' but the script has been tweaked . The first half revolves around many light moments and there is some drama as well. The interval bang was interesting. The second half has few hiccups and lacks pace but there is the required melodrama. The twist in the end is good. Overall Dolly Ki Doli is a average story about a runway bride coning men for a living. Story was novel presentation not upto mark,was funny in spurts though. It is a one time watch, its time pass entertainment was hoping for more, its not long though so its doesn't bore. Watch with limited expectations2.5/5* or 5.5/10" 
" Predictable plot. Some genuine laughs and some speed breakers.","Make no mistake Dolly ki Doli has some really good funny moments. But still, Dolly ki Doli tastes like a half baked potato. If you have seen the trailer you will pretty much know what's going to happen next in the movie. Though first half is a decent one, the story of the movie is too convenient in the second half. Performance wise all have done a decent job. But, direction is pretty ordinary. Its really a shame if you have to include 4 songs in a movie that runs less than 100 min. Also the predictability of plot does not help much. As a whole, the movie is an average fare. Watch it if you don't have anything else to do." 
" Flawed nonsensical movie","What the hell did I just watch? All throughout the movie I kept thinking, maybe the end climax will turn everything around. All the muddled puzzle pieces will suddenly fall into place. Something like 6th sense, or fight club, or Kahaani. Alas, this dumb movie never attempts to answer the most obvious flaws it contains. The ending is just like the rest of the movie- crappy. Sonam Kapoor's acting was quite shallow. Unlike her previous movies. Rajkumar Rao was the only average character in the movie. He tried providing some comic relief with his witty dialogues. Unfortunately, the storyline was so bleak and thinly plastered, that even his dialogues could not support it. All others just tanked down." 
" Weirdly fails to exploit its novel con-plot showing the viewers 'Baba Ji Ka Thullu' in the end.","Clearing the confusion over its inspired status first, yes the early half of the film (or the initial 20 minutes) are exactly similar to the Punjabi film RONDE SAARE VYAH PICHHON aka RSVP released in 2013. But since both the writers deny seeing each other's films and claim to have taken the idea from few real life instances featured in the daily newspapers, hence we are forced to consider this as possibly a rarest of rare exception of two unrelated minds writing and visualising exactly similar sequences in their individual films released at a gap of more than one year.Next keeping in mind its fairly novel plot of a 'Looteri Dulhan' and a whole con-family involved it the cunning business, DOLLY KI DOLI does have an interesting premise to offer. But after making a fine, enjoyable beginning, what the writer and director do with the film post intermission (different from RSVP) is really sad and awful, completely ruining its winning potential altogether. For instance it straight away begins with an abrupt scene introducing the lead pair chatting casually followed by an item song by the producer (Malaika) herself and then displays several big loopholes in the con games being played by the 'Looteri family' with two young boys. Still few enjoyable performances, funny local lingo and double meaning dialogues thankfully steal the limelight and one doesn't really care about the flaws in its initial 45- 50 minutes to be honest.However post intermission, the 100 minute film goes entirely off-track and starts moving in various weird directions involving betrayals, silly love angles, revenge and more. The writers come with such weird and forced ideas like the family fleeing fearing a police raid, but forgetting to take along their old age (fake) Dadi.and then remembering about her while sitting in the train. Moreover here we have a young energetic inspector who is unable to find the con-girl but the other victim boy can find her so easily, reaching her new home too without any problem as such. Plus, I really couldn't understand what help did the film get from a lackluster cameo of Saif Ali Khan doing nothing.In other words, in its second hour DOLLY KI DOLI simply fails to encash on its fresh con-plot leading towards an illogical climax and only three people give you something to enjoy in its short duration namely, Rajkummar Rao (with his excellent Haryanvi accent), Varun Sharma (reminding you of his 'Choocha' act in FUKREY) and Archna Puran Singh (as a loud Punjabi mother looking for a better girl for her boy). Strangely Sonam Kapoor is simply there in the lead role just to smile or look good and both Pulkit Samrat and Mohammed Zeeshan Ayyub are not able to deliver the expected due to their badly written roles. Brijendar Kala, Rajesh Sharma and Ishtiaq are entertaining in their small cameos, whereas debutant director Abhishek Dogra really could have delivered a much better enjoyable con-comedy with such a cast ensemble. The cinematography and background score remain average and so does its soundtrack having all mediocre unimpressive tracks (except "Mera Naina") with sick lyrics such as "Aaj Phatte Tak Nachhna" (now I really don't know what it means!) and "Launda Jawaan Banega Yahan Mere Passion Mein".great indeed!'To conclude, as the film ends another song starts playing along the end- credits with the words,'Baba Ji Ka Thullu'. And one truly feels like having shown the signature sign while walking out of the theatre. In short, one might enjoy it partially while watching it (free of cost) during a channel telecast but sparing your precious time and money on a multiplex ticket is certainly not recommended." 
" Waste of time","Far from entertainment , Poor screenplay , story line is not well thought." 
" Interesting Premise, flawed execution","Story about a con woman & her motley crew. She does the run away bride act with the moolah of her groom, after marriage. The victims are selected for their gullibility. It starts of interestingly and seems a a different plot. But, it quickly goes downhill after the first "wedding" and even the director seems clueless on how to proceed further and thankfully keeps the movie within 2 hours. Lot of logic is thrown out of the window and the protagonist act of Sonam is wooden which goes against the movie. Somebody like KanganaRanaut would have probably suited the role much better. RajKumarRao stands out with his Haryanvi accent and act.Overall, it's an OK movie, just for the premise and light viewing." 
" A movie which will only appeal to Sonam Kapoor fans","Dolly Ki Doli is a a typical good Indian movie which includes comedy.good story and a good climax. But it only us a movie which will appeal to Sonam Kapoor fans despite any flaws in it.Plot: Dolly is a con women who marries men from different religions. At night gives the whole family drugged milk and run off. An officer Robin Singh is given the task to catch Dolly and her entire family of con artistsFlaws: The story is going in a good way but the ending is very poorly written. That is the only reason why I give this movie a 9 out of 10.Acting: Sonam Kapoor is proving her potential as an actress. She first come with "khoobsurat" which in which she was flawless, now she came with Dolly Ki Doli which shows that her potential as an actress is growing.Rajkummar Rao is another actor to watch out for. Pulkit Samrat delivers what is expected of him which is not much. Varun Sharma is quit unbearable. Archana Puran Singh is superb in her cameo Overall this is a very typical Indian movie which will only appeal to Sonam Kapoor fans."
