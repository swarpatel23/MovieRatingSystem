" Not bad.","I have watched this movie three times now. The last time I watched it, I didn't enjoy it that much. But I understood it way better. The movie's story: Ajju, Johnny, & Vicky are blamed for stealing a precious 10th century crown from an exhibition. The real culprit is the much feared Chindi Chor. So when the police is chasing this trio, their red car goes through a wall and transports them in the 10th century. From their on begins their adventures in the 10th century. Flaws of the movie: I feel they didn't portray the 10th century well enough. Good parts: The movie is entertaining, unlike the usual Hindi movie drama. The acting is good. The costumes are appealing. If you have nothing else to do, go ahead and rent a copy of Funtoosh. You will enjoy it, hopefully." 
" Paresh Rawal screws up again!","After the disastrous Jodi Kya Banai Wah Wah Ramji, Paresh Rawal yet again delivers a low-IQ "comedy" in Fun2shh.  I don't know why this film was marketed as a mass audience film.  I feel little kids would enjoy this movie, and it should have been publicized as one.  Paresh Rawal better start picking up good scripts because he's losing the credibility he gained after giving sidesplitting humor in Hungama and Hera Pheri.  The songs in Fun2shh were pretty lame except "Yeh Dhuaan Dhuaan."  That was quite melodious and interesting.  This movie also conjured Kadar Khan, comedian of the '80s, and Farida Jalal, mom of the '90s.  Surprise, surprise.  They make the film look quite outdated, especially Kadar Khan."
