" the facial expression and eyes of aamir, the method acting of aamir, the direction of hirani and the superb screenplay.","I saw this film with my entire family and everybody loved it. My ten year old daughter laughed the most in the first half. The story itself is very intriguing, it successfully provokes your thoughts and captures your imagination with interesting questions. In terms of comedy the first half is better than 3 idiots and munnabhai franchisee. The second half is thought provoking and social message. No action, no special effects - justÂ good acting and direction and awesome message. It is a simple film, yet it has an everlasting message. Aamir acted brilliantly. Anushka was decent. Hirani's direction was very good. Prepare to be moved. Hats off to the director, actors and producers for tackling serious issues which is plaguing our country. Not getting scared by fringe elements and going ahead with this subject needs courage. Nowadays everybody wants to play safe and just earn money. There's two kinds of people in this world when you boil it all down. You got your talkers and you got your doers. Most people are just talkers, all they do is talk. But when it is all said and done, it's the doers that change this world. And when they do that, they change us, and that's why we never forget them. So which one are you? Do you just talk about it, or do you stand up and do something about it? Because believe you me, all the rest of it is just coffee house and bullshit. Bollywood can tackle social issues. Bollywood can really educate people. But 80% of bollywood is just talkers and hypocrites and gold diggers. Films like A Wednesday, Shahid, tare zameen par, dhobi ghat, 3 idiots, munnabhai part 1 and 2, paan Singh tomar, haider, sangharsh really belongs to doers." 
" Masterpiece.","Very unfamiliar with Bollywood and its protagonists, but I took a chance on this film, and I have to say-it contains an extremely powerful message. This film possesses a lot of HEART. I laughed, I cried, and everything in between. I loved it so much I recommended it to friends right away. I even told them I would buy their tickets. This film is a multi-topic piece that, we, as humans (no matter where we are from) should seek answers to. The main characters in the film are very expressive and communicate its content effectively. I believe in this movie and its essence. Awesome-hands down the best film I have seen. Well done on this film, well done. Ten stars." 
" Best Film Ever","Watched PK! It's by far the best film I have ever seen in my life. Aamir has given performance of his life.Best film of Rajkumar Hirani and Aamir Khan's career. This film is once in a lifetime experience. This film is made with a lot of hard work which can be seen clearly.Aamir is a legend. Anushka has done wonderful work too. Sushant is brilliant in a small role..Also great act by Saurabh Shukla. each and everyone has done their work brilliantly..this film is father of 3idiots.This is a must watch film. message is very strong. this film makes u cry , laugh and force u to think. this is a brilliant film. once in a lifetime experience. I am going with full 10/10 with this film." 
" An innocent comedy movie that not just makes you laugh your hearts out but makes you think as the movie proceeds. Brilliant work done by Rajkumar Hirani and Aamir Khan.","2 things: Aamir Khan, Rajkumar Hirani. Actually, one needs nothing more than this to go and watch the movie. Two of the finest people in their craft when join hands, you can expect nothing short of a BLOCKBUSTER, in every sense of the word. Saw this movie first day, first show and might I add the occupancy of the theater was about 60% for a 10:00 am show. That speaks for itself about the enthusiasm that people had about the movie. The year 2014 has surely ended with a SMASH HIT. I was disappointed with Aamir after Dhoom 3 and I guess I am not alone but this movie makes up for everything, every darn thing. It is not Aamir's best performance but would surely count as one of his best. What makes it so bloody brilliant is the story which takes some pretty serious subject matters and portrays them to the audience in a way that the audience can only laugh, and when in the serious scenes, they do not laugh, what they do is reflect over what happened and THINK and the obvious BRILLIANT direction by Rajkumar Hirani. This movie makes you THINK. PK caters to both the types of audiences, one who just want uninhibited CRAZINESS and just want to ENJOY their time while they watch a movie, and the other, who want the movie to make sense and make you think, they want to learn something from it. THIS MOVIE CATERS TO BOTH!! Sushant Singh Rajput was used adequately in the movie, some might feel his role was small but I don't think so. Sanjay Dutt does justice to his role too. Boman Irani had a small role, smaller than that of Sanjay Dutt's. Anushka Sharma was pretty okay. Nothing great or spectacular. Oh and, watch out for that SURPRISE at the end of the movie!! PLEASE GO AND WATCH, YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!!" 
" Hirani takes innovation and creative thinking to a different level","While entering the theater, I was excited and so were many people in my vicinity. Being a Rajkumar Hirani flick, one can hardly expect disappointing but you never really know. After 3 idiots in 2009, it took Hirani a hiatus of five years to come up with PK. But does this deliver enough to live up to its promise? Well, I feel proud to say this, Hirani has not let us down. Aamir Khan this time in PK has left no stone unturned and has put in his best for his role. From his physique to his language, the actor is simply brilliant. Indulging himself in a role of an innocent outsider(the role which suits Aamir perfectly), he speaks more with his expressions than any of the actors do with their words. With Aamir on the frontier, it is hardly fair game for the remnant of the crew to show their finesse. Quite to the contrary, Anushka plays an adequately important role in doing her best to ameliorate the humour. Sanjay Dutt who appears in parts is also fabulous. Now, the screenplay. Magnificent. Every dialogue and the successive is written, furnished and polished with extreme care and prowess. Music by Ankit Tiwari does not differ from the director's previous movies, they are quite decent and go hand in hand with the plot. I went to the theater excited and came out learning something. PK is a movie which entertains you every minute with its creativity in successfully creating an atmosphere of humour and exuberance. PK is out to provoke but not to shock. The film asks questions via its idiot savant protagonist, but does not attempt to deliver facile, absolute answers. And that makes it all the more effective. PK is an adventure which will make you laugh heartily, make you feel heart rended and make you learn to let go, simultaneously promulgating a message. PK is something i would describe, as an emotional roller-coaster. PK is an experience of a life time.If you have people with orthodox thinking in your proximity or people who are led to blind beliefs of religious drama or are puritanical, PK is just the movie for them. For others, this goes without saying, a must watch.My rating - "An emotional masterpiece" Traditional rating - 9.5/10." 
" The best Indian satire movie till date","Till yesterday, the benchmark for the best Hindi movie was 3 Idiots. But after watching PK, I would say that the benchmark should be changed. The same team that brought 3 Idiots has brought another magnificent movie. Everyone in the movie acted exceptionally well. The manner in which the social issues are depicted is very good. If we see the comedy aspects alone, 3 idiots is better. But if we see the social issues taken, PK is far better than the other movie. This is Aamir's best performance till date. Ranbir Kapoor comes in a comical guest role. Anushka Sharma, Sushant Singh Rajput and Saurabh Shukla are the other main characters.Overall rating- 9.5/10" 
" Aamir's best performance till date.. again.. and again...","I don't know whether most of the people actually knew the plot, but surprisingly I did, somehow some brilliant guy about an year ago already guessed or leaked the plot of the movie and I SERIOUSLY THINK it must be some spot boy jerk. But anyways, despite knowing the plot I still went to see the movie, that too First day first show. The moment I saw the plot becoming real within the first 10 minutes, I was skeptical whether I will like this movie. But to my surprise Aamir Khan blew me away with his incomparable acting skills and cuteness of the character. He will make you feel as if you are looking at a child who has been introduced in the world for the first time but has a consciousnesses. The main subject of the movie or so to say the "Strong Message", has been adapted by many movies before but PK stands far out from any of them. This movie will make you laugh but also make you cry. My year definitely ended with such a present from Rajkumar Hirani." 
" A great social comedy movie","First half of the movie focuses on comedic aspect. I think the last time I heard such hearty laughs were at 3 idiots screening. Amir Khan's acting is brilliant as always. Whoever wrote this story had given it much thought on the basic idea as it was thought provoking and tries to shatter the root of evil in our religious society. But the upper layers of the story were like any other Indian movie, with same emotional drama in awkward places, a love story, an evil guy who gets ridiculed, etc. Thus the movie couldn't get too deep. It couldn't deliver to its full potential, but at any moment in the story I didn't feel bored. Songs are right on spot and creates a good mood. The movie also makes you realize how colorful, beautiful yet complex Indian society is. If you liked the movie Oh my god! then I am sure you would like this too. Worth a watch anyway." 
" It's literally, the best film of Aamir khan's carrier","PK is the biggest achievement of Aamir Khan's carrier and Raju Hiranis too. Aamir acting and expressions deserve an Oscar. The film has everything. Emotion, Drama, Comedy, Message which literally means perfection. PK was the toughest character for not just Aamir Khan but, for anyone in the Bollywood industry. Not only Aamir, but Anushka Sharma and Sanjay Dutt did a very good job of their character which I think no one could have done. Sushant Rajput also did a fine job of his character.Like everything in this film is perfect. I insist you to go and enjoy the film because it's like a word of mouth movie. PK is like a father of 3 idiots." 
" Wow - I was not expecting this.","This is a comedy about a guy who is naked in the middle of nowhere in a desert along some railroad tracks with nothing but a boom-box who is struggling, like so many of us do, with the failed promises of religion. All he wants ... is his remote back. I am a huge Aamir Khan fan and I loved 3 Idiots. In fact, I have the love song Zoobie Doobie as my ring tone. So - as soon as they announced this movie - I knew I wanted to see it. The marketing campaign only peaked my interest more. Why is Aamir naked in the middle of the desert with a boom-box? This is the question even my son was asking. Why? Who is his character. Then - they put out the posters - and - who the heck is this PK character.Well - let me just say - I had no idea that this was going to be the plot. Wow. Let's start with the disclaimer - we don't intend to offend anyone's religion. I'm thinking - OK - I wonder what that's all about. Well, that disclaimer has to go down in history as one of the biggest understatements in all of film history.Then the opening sequence. And, I'm thinking - wow - this is REALLY a) mind blowing and b) humanistic. Being a Humanist, I loved it - but it seemed a bit extreme for an Indian movie given that India is such a religious country. Having such a science based opening with the philosophy that goes with it - was a bit shocking. I loved it, but it was totally unexpected because it was so expansive.The foundation of this film is the struggle of someone to come to terms with the failed promises of religion. And it's REALLY funny. I saw it in a nearly sold out theater in America and people were applauding some of the most pointed critiques of religious practice - not because they were anti-religious - but because it was pro-human. There are some really funny moments in this movie, like Aamir trying to bring wine into a mosque had the entire audience laughing. Again, not because it was making fun of Muslims, but because of how clueless the character PK is. It's also heartbreaking - stunningly so. And as I've been digesting this movie over the past day or so - I realize that the artistic choices to break our hearts in the way this movie does - was incredibly well done. It's so sudden and unexpected that it's perfect for the story line and the social point they are making. Even the ending is really astonishing. Aamir is just staring at a shoe in his hand, and yet, what is happening around him is creating so much tension. And you know how it's going to end, but that doesn't make you any less tense hoping that it will end how you want it to. They built the tension up and released it perfectly and Aamir's performance, as understated as it was - because he was just looking at a shoe, was amazing. I was shocked by this film, but in a really good way. If you are a Humanist, you really need to see this film. If you are religious, but frustrated with the con men speaking on behalf of your faith - see this film. You won't be disappointed. As someone said as I passed by - it's about time someone said what we have all been thinking." 
" PK will definitely win your hearts.","You'll laugh your hearts out, you'll cry, you'll leave the theater inspired, and with a sense of joy, that only a Rajkumar Hirani film can give to you. Aamir was the heart and soul of the movie. You can't take your eyes off of him. Anushka Sharma was brilliant too. She has evolved as an actor over the years, and it clearly reflects in her role. Sanjay Dutt and Sushant chipped in with some brilliant cameos. This movie is definitely the best of 2014. In Rajkumar Hirani, we trust.P.S. There's a pleasant surprise right at the end. Enough said, go book your date with PK.Sai Ram" 
" The best way to end this year- Watch PK!!! Ride of laughter and reality","Mixture of comedy and some lifetime lessons together constitute PK. A journey in which you will learn the life lessons and face the reality of our society in a different way.Amir's acting, Anushkha's cuteness and Shushant's innocence will win your heart. Thanks for making this film Mr. Hirani. At least somebody is there don't make movies just for money. Every dialogue, every scene was so perfect that you will a smile on your face all the time. Loved the simplicity of the movie. Beautiful locations, amazing songs and the funny dialogues adds spice to the movie.A must watch movie for all." 
" False review by Asad Khan Nasar","Hey man its 02:00PM in Pakistan and first show starts at 01:45PM, then how come you have watched this movie while living in Pakistan. You are just a Aamir Khan hater and nothing else. In your hate you have judged this movie without even watching it.I am not saying this movie is brilliant because I haven't watched it. I would definitely watch it today and if I didn't like it then I would write another review. But rating a movie or writing a review without even watching the movie is against ethical standards and IMDb policy as well. I would suggest people to not take any reviews seriously until after few more hours." 
" Message Received.","Had a bulk of Expectations from PK while I was walking into the Cinema hall. This film created buzz ever since the 1st Poster was released. All the promos were intriguing & made me watch the film. And as usual Rajkumar Hirani & Aamir Khan didn't disappoint me. Rather i got more than what i expected. Started off with a Simple Love story between Anushka & Sushant Singh Rajput which could look a li'l dull at times. But it picked up nicely ever since Aamir Khan got into the frame. There are Laughter riots throughout the 1st half. The song 'Bhagwan..' was Picturised amazingly. The song sang by Sonu Nigam left me with moist eyes. But the main focus of the film was to put light on our way of thinking about the Godmen. 'PK' takes this message a few steps higher than what we saw in Paresh Rawal starrer 'Oh My God'. It also brightened the focus on people's point-of-view towards different Religions. The 1st half was full of pace and some memorable scenes. 2nd half started off a little slowly with a couple of stretched scenes (that had no need of). But it again picked up pace and headed towards the Climax with lots more drama, laughter and excitement. For me, it's one of the Best executed films i have seen recently. One of the Best fims of 2014 for sure (along with the likes of 'Haider' & 'Queen') if not the Best. It's also a very timely released film as the devastating terror attack took place in Pakistan a few days back. Talking about the acting, Aamir Khan has just Killed it once again. I can't recall when is the last time I came across such a brilliant performance in bollywood. His Acting, his expressions, his style - everything was just beautiful. Arguably his Best Ever Performance. Anushka Sharma, playing a TV Journalist has also done a commendable job. Sourabh Shukla looked extra- ordinary in his Bald look. he was awesome as usual. Sunshat & Boman were good in their respective small roles. PK is a Trademark Rajkumar Hirani Film written all over it with Laughter, Emotions, Drama & an important Message. I would Love if the whole Bollywood starts making films like Raju Hirani without caring about Box Office Records as Baba Ranchoddas says, "Chase Excellence, success will follow you" ;) & lastly, if you are a Bollywood lover, then you'll have a huge Surprise at the End of the Film. :)" 
" P.assed with first K.ilass","Director Mr. Raj Kumar Hirani have different sensibilities, which he proved again. His style of depiction of a serious subject on a light note with humor toppings are again delicious. I love, respect and support this subject so there would be changes of being little positively biased. This is a very good extension of one of my favorite flick "Oh My God". That one was of single plot but PK is multi plotted. Story is just to support and explore the basic idea of film but it's interesting. Screenplay by Director himself and Abhijit Joshi is fresh, logical and different even being very close to "Oh My God". Dialogues by director and writer duo are perfect and logical. In a scene, where Amir Khan is emotionally broken then blast in the background enhances the intensity and carry forward the story ahead very smoothly. The use of old song in a very light note or serious note is also interesting especially "Pardesi Pardesi Jana Nahi" in beginning and "Aasman Mein Hai Khuda Aur Zameein par Hum" in between the film, is good tribute and use of songs. Now this type of film must have been made to rebel the business of fear. We should change our lifestyle by not being God fearing but becoming God loving. Hope such type of films will make changes even a little. Love is a side track but it's very good and emotional with a message too. I personally feel that after a long gap this movie has repeat value. Performance wise Hats off to Amir Khan. He is absolute perfect and first time I witnessed him, doing fantastic in emotional scenes too. He needs extra praising for always choosing something different subject with a message too. Anushka Sharma is fantastic. Her look is different and expressions are very real. Sanjay Dutt is endearing. Shaurav Shukla and Parikshat Sahni are very good. Sushant Singh Rajput is fine. Boman Irani is impressive. Music is melodious, lyrics are perfect. Both gel with the mood and subject of the film very well." 
" Always A Great work by Raju And Aamir..","I think the movie PK is the best movie of the year. this is the right way to say GOOD BYE to this year.When Raju Sir and Aamir khan make a movie together its make a new record. PK is also create a New record.about the film I don't say anything, because you go And see the movie. I can say only one thing that it change your mind about god. just see the movie you know why I gave 10 points. best movie. Fantastic movie. i am only say one thing that all of you like this movie.Because it doesn't take too much mind to understand and everyone can see this movie without feeling bored. Anushka Sharma also done a great job in this movie.Another Great work Of Raju Hirani and Aamir Khan."
