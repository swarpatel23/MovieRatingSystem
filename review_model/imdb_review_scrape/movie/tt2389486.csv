" Not for everyone","Watching Padmini Kolhapure in 'Mai (2013)' made me wonder, 'What doesn't she do more films'? She is easily one of the best female actresses in Hindi movie today. She carried the movie on her shoulders. She has ample 'thehraav' which is the single most important ability in an actor. About the movie itself, you it's watchable only if you empathize with the issue of old parents. Asha Bhosle isn't an actor and don't expect it. You'd develop compassion for her character. Or else, like reviewers on IMDb who rated it very poorly, you simply can't tolerate the movie. The movie might have been a reflection to some and not necessarily a palatable one. But what motivated me to write about my experience of watching it wasn't the movie, but Padmini the actor. (Eros Now is a great app to see new and old Hindi movies. You can play it through Apple TV or Chromecast on your HD TV. At just Rs 120 per month, it's an alternative to the costlier Netflix for those who primarily watch Hindi movies)" 
" Total Garbage!!!","Oh God!!!!! This is probably the Worst Film ever!! RGV Ki Aag is also Oscar worthy in front of this garbage! This movie marks the debut of THE Asha Bhosle, I don't know why did she makes a decision of acting! This movie has 6 songs. All the songs were too long and too monotonous! Padmini Kolhapure acted BADLY!!! Kishtee Jog was also awful. Ram Kapoor clearly seemed uninterested in what he was doing. Zanine Bhosle sings badly, Asha is better of singing. This film is total garbage filled with garbage actors and unnecessary songs, scenes and comedy!! The story was OK but Asha's acting was the Worst thing in this garbage film Watch Mai only if you want an unending headache!! I wish I could give it 0. Better kill yourself. Don't fall for Asha's complements towards this film. Save your money, Save time and Most importantly, Save your LIFE" 
" Why?!","It was a waste of whatever hours the movie lasted for, good lord, I don't know what I was thinking. This movie is a waste of brilliant actors like Ram Kapoor, Padmini Kolhapuri, and all the rest except for Asha THE Bhosle, who for sure cannot act. I will not deny the fact that she sings well... and obviously carries herself well, but watching her in this movie was simply a torture one can go through, hard core overacting and it didn't seem legitimate. Story was OK to a limited bit because of Alzheimers, which hardly has been considered about as a topic by bollywood, but was blown out of proportion in this one for sure. And if you don't agree, go watch the film and curse yourself. :)"
