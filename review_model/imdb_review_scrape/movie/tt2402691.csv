" A beautiful touching movie which makes you think hard!!","After a long time watched a short movie which made an impact with just two characters,simple set and simple conversation between a husband and wife on their first night.This movie so beautifully puts forward the Irony of our Indian society in which women are treated like a body without any mind and soul and to what extent men can be chauvinistic. A commendable job done by Director Parimal Aloke who acted so naturally as a high headed Indian man and the last song in the movie sung by him is so touching. The actress plays the role of a coy bride to perfection showing the helplessness of women in this male dominated society. A BIG THUMBS UP to Parimal Aloke and his team for this movie." 
" A Rare Short Film to come out of India in recent times","When I started watching this film, I had all the prejudice that one has while watching any short film these days. Its gonna be either about suicide, or Schizophrenia or just a boring Conversation of a couple after a break up. As the film progressed, I kept on getting more engrossed in the way, Parimal Alok, the director of the film was revealing the layers one by one. The acting and the characterization were bang on no doubt, but even then it is tough to hold the attention if the film has nothing but just one location. The story does indeed provide you with a lot of scope but, the real trick that the makers pulled off has to be "immensely awesome acting" , n personally, I consider that a Director has no other job to do other than first getting the Acting right.I had no idea that, someone could take a page from an old story in Hindi literature and carve a gem out of it in 10 minutes. Hats off to Parimal & Parul..." 
" A short film - the first night of a bride and her groom","At first glance Saari Raat seemed simple enough. A short film depicting the first night of a bride and her groom. The getting to know phase as I like to put it. It is indeed a simple story and yet the complexities of the characters not so much. The mentality, "its OK for me to do it but not so much for you" is blaringly disturbing and so in your face. Even as I said to myself that this mostly happens only in small towns and not with the educated lot, I knew I was being less than honest with myself. It is a phenomenon that we have witnessed again and again, be it in the cities, with the so called educated or that "phoren return dude". Dir- Parimal Aloke keeps the audience engaged throughout the narrative. The scenes are seamless and the actors have both done an incredible job in portraying the shy bride and her excessively chauvinistic husband. A great effort by Parimal Aloke and looking forward to seeing more of his work" 
" Something Different !!!!","Just today i had the chance to watch this short film in my college in which the director and actor Parimal Aloke visited along with Paru Gambhir and a couple of his team members to.They had visited our college to give us a special screening of the movie!And i have to say that the movie was something different,nothing which is normally seen in a short movie.The issues were touched upon very sensitively and managed to hold my attention for the entire movie! Both the actors have done a commendable job as they had the responsibility of keeping a strong screen presence and executing the story well! Hats off to Parimal Aloke for playing the chauvinistic Indian male with ease who doubts his wife no matter how much she tries to convince him , and also Paru Gambhir for playing the ever so doubted Indian bride! But yes i have to say i realized in the end of the movie that Parimal Aloke,the director was in fact the Groom (needless to say the fact that the mustache made the difference)and yes neither did i recognize Paru Gambhir (may be the make up i guess! ) Hats off to the director and i wish him the best of luck for the success of his movie! My Rating - 7/10 (Worth a watch)" 
" Saari Raat... simple , real and lots of fun !! ;-)","Saari Raat ! the thought of watching a short movie with Parimal being a part of it, was making me excited, I had never been to a short movie screening, my wife was with me ....I didn't know what will be the pace and what is there in store for us in the movie....The movie started and kept on moving at a pretty good pace, it brought a lot of smiles and frequent laughter on our face... it was so simple yet immensely entertaining ....the flow in which dialogues moved, the ease with which both Parimal and Paru took the conversation ahead was worth applauding...The emotions were all there ... the curiosity in the mind of a groom on the first night about the bride was so well depicted... Loved it ... we enjoyed each and every scene, every word they said.. it looked so natural... just like we were peeping into a real life couple's bedroom window...Full marks to Parimal ... Good work buddy ... looking forward to see more such movies from you.... We had a good time watching it.. my best wishes for Parimal for his upcoming ventures ... God bless you ....Ritesh" 
" A great watch","It is one of those movies that you wish could have been a bit longer. The character of an Indian groom who doubts his wife's integrity has been beautifully played by Parimal Aloke in the context of the depicted Indian culture. The film successfully brings out the fact that in Indian society pre-marital affairs in case of boys are viewed very differently than for girls. Paru Gambhir plays a perfect role of a whimsical Indian wife. The acting of both Parimal and Paru are very natural and captivating. It is very interesting to watch Paru teasing Parimal about her relationship(s) before their marriage. Definitely a very different movie with a lot of character. Awesome movie." 
" Excellent film","Saw this film in Florida, USA Found it to be well composed and well played out. I found it fascinating that the inter-play between a man and a woman does not change from culture to culture. A man is raised to think of himself so completely different than what society teaches a woman about self-worth. Parimal played the groom's part teasingly well. His eyes were so full of the self and yet self doubt. His bride was so sad - eager to please and be accepted, selling herself so short and so convincingly. The never ending struggle of two people trying to blend into one. Yet the male having to dominate and the female being fearful for herself and her future. It is a dance that is done everywhere and so few people are willing to see it for what it is. Excellent writing and a work well done. I recommend this film."
