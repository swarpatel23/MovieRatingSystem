" Why must we live for our children's happiness alone?","A friend of mine had watched Listen Amaya when it was screened as a part of the London Asian Film Festival and had raved about it. I hadn't even heard of the film, but when she spoke of it, looking it up on Google and IMDb, I realised that it had come and gone.I've watched the film on DVD yesterday and I have to say, the praise is justified!I am a middle aged divorc√©e. While Listen Amaya speaks of two widowed people wanting to start a relationship, I see so many subtle themes that are at play here, that I can so easily relate to what happens on screen.Children have no right over their parents or their lives, and for the vast majority of Indians, it is almost impossible to comprehend that fact. Our responsibility towards our children is to bring them up, care for and nurture them to become free thinking individuals, in their own lives. I as a parent though, still reserve the right to live mine the way I see fit. If I choose to take a partner, whether in marriage or in civil partnership, it is my fundamental right to do so.I enjoyed the way Leela and Jayant's love story unfolded with such grace and simplicity. I thoroughly enjoyed the liberal use of intelligent humour and I admit that I also choked at some of the more emotional moments. Rarely have I seen a film which touches on sensitive issues and still stays away from sermonizing about what is right or wrong. That doesn't mean the film has no flaws. It could easily have been a little shorter in the first half of the film. It definitely did not need any songs, although two of them are situational and therefore may be discounted. While the language used is primarily Hindi, there is too much English for it to be accepted as a mainstream film and therein lies it's biggest problem. A film like this deserves to be seen by a very wide audience, because so many people will connect with it, but it does itself no favors by targeting a small section of that audience by the limited marketing it seems to have done.If I don't agree with the way Leela and Jayant dealt with Amaya's abject pigheadedness, I also understand that it is a deeply personal reaction and that everyone's will be different. So while I won't judge the characters, I will judge what the film did for me. Listen Amaya made me take notice of smaller, independent films that are being made today, which rely on story telling rather than a marketing blitz to sell tickets, or DVD's! It also renewed my faith in the fact that cinema can still entertain, without resorting to cheap gimmickry or sleaze.See it if you can, because it's two hours that will stay with you for a lot longer than the time you took to watch it." 
" What a surprising good film","I am not a big film buff and when I do watch some, I enjoy English films normally. It is also too expensive to watch Hindi films in theaters because of the nonsense you are forced to watch usually.This film was on my wife's radar and she was very angry when it did not release in Hyderabad. Maybe the makers did not think there is an audience for it - I don't know. I also read some critics reviews of the film which were a mix of being good and some bad, so I was not particularly upset at not being able to watch it, till my wife bought the DVD!Without re-telling the entire story, because it is already online, I will only say one thing. That I am very surprised at this film.The film is simple, but the storytelling could be from any number of foreign films from around the world. The dialogues are so spoken, they sound like they are written by you and me and part of a conversation that we would have in our homes. This is what makes this film and it's writing so unique. You do not see this in Hindi films, not even in what people today refer to as the new Indian cinema. The settings are attractive and though you can see Fabindia furniture in many frames, it does not distract from the story because the characters seem to belong there. That is the other thing that struck me, that the characters looked like they were comfortable, but not necessarily affluent. These are people who will be found in almost every metropolitan city of India, but never in Hindi films from our country!Farooq Sheikh and Deepti Naval are brilliant. Understated and quiet, their performances are like a masterclass in acting. Swara Bhaskar! She is very good and truly talented, but I felt maybe she could try and emote a little bit more. It might be a matter of the script or it might be her ability, but I felt that although she was very good in her role, she could have brought a little more to her character. Amala is an interesting choice of actor for a film like this and she is still very attractive to look at but her acting starts to pale, when you compare her to Farooq and Deepti, who are almost the same era of actors. The boy who is Swara's love interest started to irritate me after a while, till he changes his character in a swift masterstroke from the film makers at a crucial juncture of this story. But overall, the performances of all the actors is beyond reproach. Spoiler alert. One of the most funny scenes in the film is when a character comes to Deepti and Swara's house, mistaking Deepti to be married to Farooq. It is played out with such a deft hand, that it seems incredible that a scene like this finds itself in Hindi cinema. Nothing is said, and yet everything is obvious to the viewer. It is very funny and I enjoyed it thoroughly. Another scene that sticks out is when Deepti finally tells her daughter about her relationship. They both react to what is being said, even though there is no dialogue being spoken. It really is very well crafted as a scene and imaginatively shot as well. I did not like the first song of the film and it almost confirmed my fears about this being another silly Hindi film, but I'm glad I waited to make a judgement. It is only because of that I will rate this film a 9 otherwise it would be an easy 10/10.I have already bought two more of the DVD's to send to my daughter and to a friend who is in a similar situation. And I also know that I will be watching this film again. There aren't many that I have watched again, so that should be a compliment which only my close friends will know I am paying to the film and it's makers.I looked for the film makers and from what I can see, this is their first feature film. Interestingly, it also seems like the makers are a young couple who have either self funded it wholly or to a large extent of it at least. I would be very curious to see what their next film is and this time, I will spend the money to see it in a cinema hall. Not because I know them, but because I think I would have enjoyed seeing Listen...Amaya in a theater too.My wife of course is having the last laugh, even though she cried at the end of this film!" 
" A hidden gem","I have already watched this film three times from when the DVD was brought home. My favorite on screen couple of Farooque Sheikh and Deepti Naval have outdone themselves again! Swara Bhaskar plays her part so well, you want to slap her right across the face, almost willing Deepti Naval to do it for you and yet, when she finally breaks down in front of her mother - you can feel the tears start to prick too.What a lovely lovely film this is! I also hate it for making me so homesick right now that I want to jump onto the next flight to Delhi and stay there forever. All of my favorite hangouts are used in big bright technicolor in Listen Amaya and brings along with it a flood of happy memories. Golf links, Khan Market, Old Delhi, Chanakya Puri, uffff.If there is also one thing that I now want to do in my life, it is to run a coffee shop like Leela's and if I can, I want to name it book a coffee as well! :) Its the sort of place where I could spend days on end, not having to leave, being immersed in the books and making friends along the way. Idyllic life no? Jayant is such a gorgeous man, even with all of his wrinkles and chubbiness. He reminds me so much of dad, that I actually called him soon after watching the film, just to tell him that he means to world to me. Sentimental foolishness maybe, but so what?Listen Amaya almost takes you back in time, to an era where decency and kindness were normal. A space where people cared for what happened around them and their families, being aware of their actions and the results it would have on people that make a difference to them. It's such a beautifully told story that I found myself crying every so often that at one point a friend watching it with me was ready to hit me! The way Leela, Jayant and Amaya all overcome their inhibitions and reservations about what is actually a beautiful love story, will make a lot of people choke. The way the film ends, aptly encircles the way the film started; a daughter who loves her mother, but doesn't have the time to listen to her, to a daughter who loves her mother intensely and realizes that she needs to make that time very often.Beautifully done as a story and film. It made my day a couple of times over." 
" What a movie..its a must watch!","For me its a 10 on 10. 'Listen..Amaya' what a great concept. Beautiful story, lovely direction, brilliant performances. Farooq Sheikh especially is at his charming best. Story is about 3 people, Leela (Deepti Naval), Jayant (Farooq Sheikh) and Amaya (Swara Bhaskar). Leela(in her 50s) is Amaya's (in her 20s) mother. Leela lost her husband when Amaya was very young. Jayant (in his 60s may be) is Leels's friend and Amaya is also fond of Jayant. Amaya is a 'free spirited modern young girl' (as Leela puts it in the movie), who is open minded and outspoken. Leela and Jayant are very comfortable in each other's company and eventually fall for each. When Leela tells Amaya that she desires to spend her life with Jayant, Amaya flips out. Amaya thinks and openly admits that it will be so embarrassing for her to confront her friends if Leela marries Jayant. The movie is about how they sort out things after that.I loved the movie, we should have more movies like these. What this gem of a movie conveys is that everyone is entitled to have a companion, irrespective of their age, no matter how embarrassing it may be for their children. And our "modern" generation which claims to hate "hypocrisy" is also "hypocritical" when it comes to matters that involve them.I look forward to more movies like these. This is the kind of movie that opens our mind. We the "younger generation" This is a fantastic movie that is a must watch for all movie lovers. I would recommend this for people of all age groups." 
" There is hope!","I don't remember the last time I've enjoyed watching a movie at home. Movies are meant to be watched in theaters and unfortunately I missed out on this wonderful film.I have to also say that it is immensely heartening to know that movies of this kind are not only being thought up, but also being produced. So, there is hope. And as they say, ultimately it really is the script that is the star, or at least that's how it should be.Leela and Jayant are two lonely widow/widowers who happen to meet each other at a cafe that is run by Leela in her home. They are naturally drawn to each other and fall into an easy relationship without the frills and silliness that is a hallmark of being younger. It is a beautifully portrayed relationship, where the silences say so much more than words ever would. Thus, when a much younger adult is suddenly faced with a relationship she is not used to seeing, her natural instincts to reject it at any cost come gushing to the surface. The reasoning she uses is so trivial, because she actually can't find a plausible reason to oppose it in the first place. The way each relationship has been treated is also refreshing, because each of the characters have their own journey's to complete. All the t's are crossed and most of the i's are dotted, without making it obvious that it is being done at all. Kudos to the director to take the risk of not saying too much. Believing in us as an audience to understand. Powerful imagery, an interesting choice of music and superlative performances from the lead actors in Listen Amaya make you wonder why movies like this are not made more often. I recently watched Lootera as well and though that film also had silences and nuances that the director used to great effect, Listen Amaya scores over Lootera simply because of the calibre of the actors enacting those silences. Farooq Sheikh and Deepti Naval are powerhouses of acting talent. Swara Bhaskar is such a fine performer and one who you should keep a lookout for. Most of the supporting cast blend beautifully with the way the story unfolds, that for almost two hours, you remain rooted to where you're sitting.But credit must also be given where it is due. Had it not been for the deft directing, the sharp, almost picture perfect cinematography, or the crisp editing, the subtle and elegant sets or even the often simple music, all of the acting would have gone in vain. Because after all, the actors are only playing out a vision of what was already put on paper, long before the film got shot. Bravo for a rapidly maturing Hindi film industry and thank God for films like Listen Amaya." 
" Good film","It is very good picture and all acting also super good. Dipti Naval and Farukh Sheik and Swara Bhaskar are too good also.All actors are telling story of girl who loves father and does not want her mother to forget him. So she is fighting with the mother and explains that she cant tell her friends about her marrying some other man, because she will be married soon.I think the issue is beautifully told and we should learn to love our parents and still have feelings for their life, because we will grow up and then how will they be alone?It is too good and I'm waiting for DVD for long time. My mother also seen film and father too because I send them the DVD after I saw it. They are also felt that it is a very good film.I like old song remix of ek larki, and will become my ringtone now :)Very good story and direction and acting, it is must watch for all children and parent." 
" Tribute to Mr. Farooq Shiekh......","Farooq Shiekh has been one of the finest actors in Indian movies who defied the concept of face value on screen and boosted quality roles and performance. "Listen...Amaya" is a story between generation gap emanating the emotional complexity between matured parenthood and disturbed youth presented through a melodrama. The film though has a very non salable cast, performances of Farooq Shiekh and Deepti Naval is really worth praising. Perhaps one of the better movies they have given together after the 80s. Well, there is very little for the people going for commercial values like songs and dances and the pace of the drama is quite slow. But overall the good performances and the story is what you would remember of this film. Just watch this as a tribute to late Farooq Shiekh. You'll like it.Rating : 2 stars out of 4" 
" A film that relied on story telling and performances","This weekend gone past has been a wonderful one, with me catching up on some films I've been procrastinating with watching. Listen Amaya just happened to be on top of the rather long list.I have to admit that I was more than a little skeptical about this film because of the wildly varying reviews I had read of it. The critics barring a few exceptions had torn the film apart, while acquaintances I came across who had seen the film, spoke highly of it. But, I thought if nothing else, actors of the caliber of Farooq Sheikh and Deepti Naval will make it bearable.The critics who take it upon themselves to behave like demi Gods and summarily be the judge jury and executioner of all films coming out of our film industry, should maybe introspect. Are they qualified to pass judgment or do they overstep their mandate by condemning films such as this to an early death, long before it has had a chance to be truly judged by a paying audience? I would not have seen Listen Amaya, had it not been for my pig headedness to watch Farooq and Deepti together again. That would have truly been my loss, which is when I would have been very very angry.A film like Listen Amaya comes along very rarely, and even less so now. No, it is not a masterpiece but as the years go by, I can see it becoming one of those films which will be used as an example to teach budding film makers that stories are all important. However simple those stories may be. The film is elegant, the dialogues are deceptively easy flowing, the shot taking is gentle and the performances are truly scintillating. My husband and I watch enough good cinema to tell when genuine talent is being exhibited on screen or behind the camera. The way certain scenes are constructed are genius in their simplicity, which makes them so astoundingly effective. One of the most poignant characters in the film has only one scene, the old watchmaker. But he is used so beautifully to set up the central premise of memory and its form, that when Jayant returns to his shop in the second half of the film, to find him having passed on; my heart ached for not just his son's loss but Jayant's as well. That is a mark of very good writing.Amaya's complete emotional breakdown as she comes to terms with and apologizes to her mother, brings a huge lump to your throat. Jayant's expression as he lets Leela into his home is masterful, since it represents so many unsaid things. Hurt, resignation, understanding and dread at the inevitable that is around the corner. The easy camaraderie between Deepti and Farooq, as Jayant charmingly flirts with Leela in full view of everyone is superlative. The comic mix up when the young man mistakes Leela and Jayant to be married and arrives for dinner at Leela's home, drew a good old belly laugh even from my usually reticent husband! Leela and Amaya's banter at the beginning of the film to Leela's expression when Amaya realizes that her mother knew all along that Jayant suffered from Alzheimer's is nothing short of brilliant. It is a scene that not many actors can pull off, kudos to Deepti and Swara.Al through the film, you can almost sense the deft touch of the makers of Listen Amaya. They never push too much that it interferes with your experience and yet they steer the film delicately through very relevant topics and issues that not a lot of people would have thought about. They explore relationships at many different levels, where the common binding factor is being in love, or loving someone to distraction. They also do it all without preaching for one moment, about what the viewer must think and that is what is really commendable. What a gutsy story to tell and tell exceedingly well. I hope it pays off for them and they get their due recognition. I really enjoyed watching Listen Amaya and have recommended it to everyone I know far and wide. I hope more films like this continue to come from the makers of this one." 
" "Listen Amaya" - A finest Attempt That Shouldn't Be Missed","It is sad that meaningful cinema is only appreciated when there are known faces or better say star power is associated with it. Have you wondered how many great pieces of arts have you missed just because of the fact that those movies either didn't had super stars or were not backed by heavy advertisements and marketing. "Listen Amaya" is one amongst those movies. This movie by Avinash Kumar Singh was screened at London Asian Film Festival and what else could it receive other than hoards of appreciation. I recently watched the movie over DVD and for 2 hours I only enjoyed each and every scene of the movie."Listen Amaya" revolves around two widowed individuals Jayanat (Farooque Sheikh) and Leela (Dipti Naval) along with her daughter Amaya (Swara Bhaskar).Leela runs a library cum coffee shop, named "Book A Coffee" with her daughter and Jayant is her routine customer, friend, admirer and what not. The story revolves around these three individuals and the complications, self-respect and egos associated with their relationships. The plot is based on very thin line where words don't need to express anything but emotions do. It is remarkably dealt as well, on screen.I have grown up watching Dipti Naval's and Farooque Sheikh's off beat movies, also known as parallel cinema of early 1980's. Movies like Chashm-e-Buddoor, Saath Saath, Kissi Se Na Kehna, Katha and Faasle etc. were a complete revelation from mainstream cinema. Coming back to "Listen Amaya", it simply touches the hearts of audience. There are many sequences where Farooque Sheikh and Dipti Naval express their emotions with extreme ease. Swara Bhasker (Amaya) expresses her uneasiness with flaw. The contradictory personalities can only be show-cased by a seasoned actress. She is another actress to look out for after Tabu, Nandita Das and Vidya Balan.Music of the movie is very light. The beauty is that all the songs are situational (though movie's length could have been decreased if the songs would be omitted). Direction is first rate and so is cinematography.If you are looking forward to watch a simple, easy going, full of mature emotions movies then this one is the perfect one. "Listen Amaya" is all about emotions and performances. It is highly recommended for those who value quality cinema or let me say a meaningful cinema. I would personally rate it 4/5 on the basis of story line, script, performances and close to reality." 
" Conflicts of love and affection","Listen....Amaya portrays the relationship between a mother and daughter. The mother, Leela, a widow, runs an arty cafe-cum-library "Book a coffee". The daughter is "a full time writer, part time cafe manager and a free spirit", as her mother describes her. For Leela, the cafe is a means to mingle with people and make new friends in addition to make a living. Amaya is a writer and is very short tempered. She hops from job to job, none of which is able to hold her due to her fiery temperament.Jayant is a retired photographer who frequently visits the cafe and is very close to both the mother and daughter. Amaya and Jayant start on a new project, a coffee table book, "Memories of a busy bazaar" with Jayant's photographs and Amaya's text. The plot takes a turn when the relationship of Jayant and Leela takes a new turn and Amaya objects to it. Her possessiveness and insecurities haunt her as she tries to come to terms with the situation. During the course of the story, all the three major characters, Amaya, Leela and Jayant are forced to reconsider their options and come to terms with realities." 
" Amazing","Listen Amaya has an amazing storyline with Acted by the great actors like Farooq Sheikh and Deepti Naval.The story say much things to society. Role played by Farooq Sheikh is amazing. No doubt he was a super fine actor. Deepti Naval played the role of Amaya's Mother is very well. overall film was amazing and liked the ending very much. Film was shot with a very low budget and this films is an example of great storyline, awesome acting and a perfect ending. Low budget makes it a very decent film.The starting of the film was OK as other films start but gradually it becomes interesting and twists in the film makes it more interesting.Swara Bhaskar who played amaya's role looks so cute in the film and adorable also. i feel its swara's best role she ever played." 
" A microscopic vision on relationship and Life!","A perfect enactment of relationships, family bonding & Life. Work of Farooq Shaikh and Deepti Naval do not require any adjectives. as there can never be enough!. Its a must watch for those who love to feel Life and Relationships dwell!. Just wonderful representation of life. The movie focuses on Relationships of a mother and daughter. Its shows how a vision of camera lens can reflect beautiful human heart. It teaches how a platform like coffee shop to can be a launch pad for life.It goes on to telling us to love overlooking the imperfections in human beings by loving the perfect hearts.You would love.Farooq Shaikh.Deepti Naval.Dialogues." 
" Handles emotions with the deserved delicacy","Truly delicate movie. I loved the way it handles the characters without portraying anyone as right or wrong. There are some very beautiful moments in the movie which i had to see multiple times to be fully satisfied. The movie is slow, so don't expect a thrilling ride. And it has lot of emotional acts where silence speaks out louder than words. At few places I felt that the script was too filmy for my taste but those moments passed away quickly before I got turned-off. Also there are some characters who don't add any value to the movie and its easy to notice that they had no contribution to the movie at all. The ending could have been better I felt. But that is just me. Good Sunday-afternoon. Enjoy and let others know :)" 
" This for sure is one of the most sensible films of recent past.","This for sure is one of the most sensible films of recent past. A must watch for the late great Faroque Sheikh.Above all, a sensitive issue of marriage at an old age has been held brilliantly and is handled with a fine sensibility. Kudos to the writer director for this. Interestingly, the directors are couple Geeta and Avinash Kumar Singh. So, the primary reason for the crackling chemistry between the lead pair Deepti Naval and Faroque Sheikh could be attributed to fact that the director are a pair themselves.Swara Bhaskar, the young was made to show up a lot of emotion which is a rarity in contemporary Bollywood. I say this because in many films, young women are used to squeeze some lust. So many films forget that these young girls are daughters of some parent and thus indulge themselves only in showcasing their curves more. I hope, she gives us more performances like this.Also, this film has things that I love and savor the most. Coffee, photography and writing. Damn, that's a deadly combo which was used intelligently to convey a sensible story. The film could have surely done away with songs or hopefully they were much better than what are there. But barring that tiny glitch it was a wonderful 104 minutes. I succumb to such films and thus, fell for this too. Look at the reference used "Miss Chamku" for Deepti Naval by Faroque. Any guesses why was it there? Go see the original Chashme Baddoor then. It's such tiny things that made this film wonderful and a cut above the rest. I just gave an example and indeed there are not many references too, still there are moments that can bring a smile.A 4/5 for this sensible film. What a way to bid adieu to the great Faroque Sheikh. A great man gone too soon." 
" One of the years best films!","I am always biased when it comes to Farooq Shaikh films. He effortlessly eases into any role he takes on with his beautifully executed nuanced performances. This movie is no exception. As Jazz Jayant, Farooq once again delivers a heartwarming A+ performance. The movie which gradually grows on you is a sensitive depiction of a mother-daughter relationship. The film deals with the insecurities faced by Amaya(Swara Bhaskar) the daughter, when she learns about the growing relationship between her mother (Deepti Naval) and her photographer friend (Farooq). The film is neither preachy nor over dramatized and takes you in with its beautiful depiction of human connections. There are many scenes where nothing is said, but a lot is conveyed simply via expressions. I loved every character in the film - each characters peels layers of emotions and helps build this beautiful thought provoking story-line. So Listen Amaya does make you stop and listen. By the way, beautiful shots of quaint bazaars in the Chandni Chowk, Hauz Khas and Khan market areas of Delhi.Overall a beautiful film, subtle and sincere. Kudos to Geeta and Avinash Singh for creating this delicate masterpiece in their first attempt. I hope they make more films in the future."
