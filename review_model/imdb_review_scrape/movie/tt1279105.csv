" Patience Tester!!!","Less said, better about this movie. This movie is so boring and irritating that even the task of writing a review for this movie seems so tedious. Why did they make such a movie?? How can the imagination of people go this bad? How the hell the actors agreed to act in this movie?? And how did the movie get distributors?? These will be the questions coming to an ordinary viewer's mind, while watching Ramaa.A more apt title for the movie would be Ramaa, the Loser. In the whole movie, he loses every fight, except the one in the climax, that too with the help of some kids.It is obvious from the plot that the movie is made to grab the attention of kids, and the idea of few kids getting trapped inside a video game is not so bad. In fact, it would be really interesting if executed in a proper manner. But that's where the makers have gone horribly wrong. The story is told in such a bad manner that we don't feel like taking our hands off the 'Forward' button, while watching the movie.Everybody knows that WWE is the TV show most kids like, after cartoons. So, the makers have added a WWE star in the movie, and it is none other than 'The Great Khali'. My serious advice to Khali is, stick to WWE, or join Indian army. But please don't do movies. We can tolerate bad actors, but this guy is too much beyond that. There are not much scenes for him in the movie, but whatever is there, he has done it in the worst possible way.If anyone can compete with Khali's acting in the movie, it would be the guy who played 'Kali' in the movie. Yes, you heard it right. Khali plays 'Vali' and this guy plays 'Kali'. This guy's acting is really bad, but fortunately he has got a more human-like face. Looks really matter, dude!! However both Kali and Vali are people with stoned faces.Oh, there is one more stone in the movie, the title character 'Ramaa' played by Sahil Khan. Seriously, how can one actor go this bad?? He is yet another stone in the movie, with a monkey-ish face. Really he should be honoured for maintaining the same expression throughout the movie.Tanusree Dutta looked better among others. She did her action sequences quite well. But frankly, she is not at all pretty.The movie revolves around few kids, and i forgot to mention about them. They were okay in their roles, and were obviously better than the other artists of the movie.The movie proceeds like a video game, but sadly it fails to make any impact due to bad editing. Also, there are few bad songs in the movie,especially the one Ramaa sings in the jungle. I felt like trashing my computer monitor and scream 'What the f*ck????'.After this movie, all i want is to ask the makers 'what the heck you have thought of yourself??'. But, this is not the worst movie, if you have watched 'Love.com'. :P. However, such movies increase our degree of tolerence!!" 
" Nice try...","I thought kids gonna like this one cause Bollywood rarely make movies for kids and this one is just for kids.. well About Story: it was good the actors were in characters in the starting of the movie i thought to quit watching but i wanted to see Sahil Khan Playing Main Character Ramaa and after The Great Khali Scene When the meet Sahil the movie was starting to pick go high and it did so the story was 0k..Characters and mistakes: All kids in the starting were like OK but the first song was like small kids singing in adult voice and that was horrible... the gaming scenes were not like real games (bad editing)..What i like: The Sahil khan Junglee song i loved that Characters after meeting ramaa were acting very good tanushree was good too khali and evil acted well action was 0kk0n the whole i give it 8 a very enjoyable movie.."
