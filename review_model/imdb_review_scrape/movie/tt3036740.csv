" You Need to be a "Himmatwala" to sit through "Humshakals"","Sajid Khan! Why? Just Why? Why do you need to make films? OK, The story is just the confusion created by 3 doppelgangers (Humshakals) Based on just the above sentence, would you make a 160 minute long film? Only Sajid Khan would.. Saif, Ritesh and Ram will be seen in lead roles, whereas Bipasha, Tamanaah and Esha would be seen in Cameos (I would say) 3 Humshakals, one trio- Normal, second trio- Abnormal and the third one - Gays. This film is shameless- Jokes on people in coma, Gay Jokes, Racist Jokes, Sexist Jokes, and irritating Aakhri Pasta (Yes, Once Again!!!) Five silly songs just to increase the length of the film, a drug which can turn you into dogs, vodka and cocaine parathas and what not. Not to forget- Prince Charles speaking Marathi and Hindi.. It doesn't have a story- The film goes on with double meaning, offensive jokes for 150 long minutes. Please skip it, I would rather recommend you to watch Himmatwala, yes you read it right, on TV. Don't go for it." 
" Officially Declared Sajid Khan the "King Of Trash"","Sajid Khan strikes back with his slap stick comedy genre with "Humshakals" but the problem is that there is not enough laughs to sustain 159 mins So Sajid goes back to his "Housefull " mould of European mansions, swanky cars, heroines wearing skimpiest costumes and too many characters who are a caricature. Sadly for "Humshakals" it falls flat and what we get is a trash in the name of comedy.The Story written by Sajid Khan of three sets of Humshakals of Ashok (Saif), Kumar (Riteish) and Mamaji alias KANS (Ram Kapoor), one set of Ashok who is heir to the multimillion empire of Sighanias, Kumar who is Ashok's best friend and Mamaji who is scheming to confiscate the empire from Ashok, another set wherein all three are mental patients Ashok, Kumar & Jhonny, and third set consists of Ashok and Kumar who are feminine by nature and Mamaji who is bar dance owner. CONFUSED well this just the beginning, Sajid thought that he could actually better Shakespeare's Comedy of Error but alas there is no story.Screenplay should I say the lack of it credited to Robin Bhatt, Akash Khurana and Sajid Khan is just a shocker and imagination just goes wild. A sequence has a doctor giving a medicine potion which makes human beings act like DOGS and you see both Reteish & Saif acting like dogs well this is utterly insane in the name of comedy. The Dialogues by Sajid Khan and Adhir Bhatt is equally bad what with "Aap Meri Zindagi mein Aaye to Mere Bacche Ka Baap Ban Jaye".The performances by the ensemble cast is just too childish to laugh, for Saif I think this is his worst performance till date. Making faces does not suffice for acting and Saif is so bad when he is imitating actors. Reteish still gives you a few laughs but he could not salvage the mayhem around. Ram Kapoor looks completely lost all throughout the movie. Satish Shah as the warden hams all throughout. The actresses have no scope to act, they are there as eye candy wearing skimpiest clothes. I can still understand for Tamanah Bhatia and Esha Gupta who are relatively new and hence they did this film but why the hell did Bipasha Basu do this film she looks like a glorified extra in the movie.The only good thing about the movie is the cinematography by Ravi Yadav which is good and catchy to the eye. Music by Himesh Reshamiya is extremely average, excluding "Caller Tune" none of the other songs are worth mentioning.Sajid Khan's "Humshakals" has outdone Ram Gopal Varma's "Aag" in making Trash, and RGV's "Aag " looks like a classic in front of SK's "Humshakals". Sajid Khan has to relearn what is entertainment before venturing to his next project." 
" Don't Waste Your Money & Time In This Clueless & Useless Movie","I watched this movie on Friday, first day first show and have lot of expectation from it, but after watching this movie i had a headache and there was nothing to laugh in the film, there was clueless comedy which doesn't make you laugh and that's why lot of people from cinema ran out from the middle of the film, I also thought to do the same, but hoping that may be this film will have something in the middle or end, but i am extremely disappointed that why i have not left the film and saved my time. This film shows that Sajid Khan didn't learn any lesson from the failure of HimmatWala and yet another Flop film is given by him. If you watch this movie you will waste your time, energy and as well as money. At some of the scenes you will laugh on Saif Ali Khan and Ritesh Dekhmukh comedy, but there are lot of repetition of one comic scene that lay down the movie." 
" worst","Worst acting. Worst direction. Worst story line. Nothing is good about the movie except music. Thanks to Himesh for adding a plus point. Its not 9 time entertainer, it will give 9 time headache. Saif is the worst of all — he is unconvincing as the man behaving as a dog, as the waitress. Just about everything he does in the movie is like he's just sleep-walking. With no story or comedy on offer, even Riteish and Ram are unable to save the day for Sajid Khan. Skip this movie if you do not want a bad headache and other after-effects of being tortured.No start we can afford for this crap. There is no option to give 0 or -ve rating, it deserves this only. Among all the actors Saif is at worst. Even a Himmatwala cannot watch this." 
" Garbage !! Sajid Khan's movies had and never will work even if he uses "H" in his future movies","As I begin writing my views on Sajid Khan's Humshakkals, the thought that do come to mind is that how silly and crap a movie can be made with massive budget , high cost production, popular star cast and widely distributed by Hollywood studio Fox Star ? There are movies like Shahid and Bheja Fry with high quality content and shoe string budget ( 80 lakhs and 50 lakhs respectively, yes you read it right ) and yet managed to impress the audience. Why do we have people like Sajid Khan making films and yet actors like Saif Ali Khan are working with him ?Humshakkals is a comedy of errors centered around 3 people who look alike each other.From the disaster movies like Housefull , Housefull 2 and Himmatwala, comes another "H" titled Humshakkals in which the definition of Story, Script and direction does not fit it. Sajid Khan dedicates the movie to likes of Jim Carrey in the beginning but at least you tend to laugh at Carry's crazy antics. In Humshakkals, you will wonder how amateurish can Sajid Khan get. Imagine a scene where there is a chain of slapping between Riteish, Saif , Ram Kapoor and Satish Shah with Shah quoting it as Slapstick Comedy. Editing is horrible. The torture goes on for almost 3 hours. Art direction is good. Cinematography is nice. Songs are pathetic. Among all the actors, Ram Kapoor gives an honest performance.Overall, avoid Humshakkals at any cost. Sajid Khan's movies had and never will work even if you uses "H" in his future movies. Garbage 1/5www.facebook.com/Filmychowk" 
" Sajid Khan was laughing at us audience, while on his way to the bank!!!","Hoped they had a 0 or even minus rating!!Thankfully (or not) we had a 8 year old amidst us and as she was finding this movie quite a fun, we had a good time hearing her laugh and watching her rolling in the seat :-)Otherwise, i assure u we would have had a stroke or would have to get ourselves admitted in Agra mental asylum ourselves!! My sympathies with guys who were not as lucky as us ....Yes we had a few laughs because my friend had warned me it would be intolerable and our expectations were ... NONE whatsoever!! That said,, what really struck me was the obvious fact in the movie that THE WRITER AND DIRECTOR HAD MADE THIS MOVIE WITH A PRESUMPTION THAT Indian AUDIENCE HAS AN IQ OF AN 8 YEAR OLD!!!!WHY ELSE DO ALL THE 'BIG BUDGET' movies like Chennai Express, Dubang 2 are made out to be as BRAINLESS as possible!!! THE DIRECTORS and producers who r investing millions are not totally idiots are they! Lets face it--- a low level shameless Hollywood rip-off ( Krish, Dahomey 3) or a BRAINLESS comedy like ( Kolyma returns, house-full, Chennai express, Humshakals) MAKE BIG BUCKS IN THE BOX OFFICE than a meaningful one like queen, Dil Chahta Hai etcAnd this brings us to an ugly truth conclusion that --Just as 70% of India lives in villages, 90% of India's audience love low IQ / poor imitation movies which are usually racist/ show women as men's sex slaves or have non-veg jokes at the cost of homosexuals and others... Akshay Kumar and SRK have very well understood this phenomenon and accordingly have changed the type of movies they sign up for. in the last ten years, they have hardly made any movie which has even an iota of meaning in it-- And yet they have gone on to become the richest of the lot!!!!Akshay Kumar, after Herapheri success, suddenly resorted to such brainless comedies ..SRK - it's hard to believe that a guy who has acted in Swades and My Name Is Khan ,, prefers to act in movies like Om Shanti Om and Chennai Express!!Both siblings- Farah (with SRK's blessings) and Sajid have eagerly embraced this formula of BRAINLESS movies and unabashedly churn out such black-hole movies...And unless the 90% Indian audience, Whose brain has been addled by Ekta Kapur soap operas, wake up from their stupor,, this is going to go on :-)Mera Bharat Mahan!" 
" Don't ... don't ... you might want to shoot yourself!!","Imagine ... and I mean try to 'visualize' what you are going to read next... "After having watched this movie in a cinema-hall, while on your way back (from it), a mad dog crosses your path. wait ... make it more ... let us say, three mad dogs. You are terrified, assuming that the dogs might bite you but. Somehow those dogs know that you have seen 'Humshakals' and that too in a 'hall'. So, instead of biting you they'll all bow down in front of you showing utter respect to the courage you exhibited!" ... I think you got the point. Why did these actors work in this movie. Why?? Certain scenes are quite funny but overall this movie is s**t." 
" Please don't torture yourself!","Yes you read it right! Actually i can sum up the whole review in just 3 words - WASTE OF TIME, but since I have to reach the maximum of 10 lines i will just have to continue. Well who doesn't know nowadays what Sajid Khan is incapable of so I don't think there is much needed about the direction part. Music is 'not music' to the ears. Performance wise - just forget it. All in all this is a movie which you should avoid even if it comes on TV without ads, because if you spend those 2+ hours staring at the ceiling will be better. The movie falls flat in almost all aspects. Well not almost it does fall flat in all aspects! A note to Sajid Khan - Please do not make any more movies coz we are better without such torture in the name of Indian Cinema." 
" you must watch this movie for following reasons","1. if you r not satisfied with your air conditioner at home and want to have a good sleep of 2-3 hours 2. if you have a girl friend but not a room (you know what I mean) 3. if you are fed up from your life and YOU want a killer method to kill yourself 4. if you r not half dead when you listened to the song CALLER-TUNEbeyond all this there's an excellent force or what we call an energy which drives the director of this movie to make it a suicidal film,which is really an ability for anyone.I really really appeal every single person to watch this movie but only if he/she has the reasons I just mentioned. The both brother sister have a great sense of movie making." 
" A Comedy so Unfunny and so Unbearable that it Leaves Emotional Scars on Your Psyche","Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 1.5/5 starsSajid Khan completely botches up what had the potential to be a rib- tickling situational comedy of errors. With premise reeking of comedy gold, on his hands, and with a trio of multi-talented male actors boasting of impeccable comic typing, only a complete twit could have ruined this movie. And what's more surprising is that Sajid Khan has been known to entertain audiences with his no-brainer, madcap, situational comedies. But, since "Himmatwala", he seems to have completely lost his mojo, or maybe he just had a limited supply of mojo that has now been exhausted over the course of his first three, laugh- out-loud, humorous adventures. In fact, there are several scenes reminiscent of his initial three hits, which seem to be mutilated into something else. The jokes fall flat, the gags are tiresome, and the exceedingly sparse amount of buildups that start out as funny, quickly swerve into painful territory because of Khan's hackneyed direction.It's criminal that the Director has completely wasted three powerhouse performers in the form of Saif Ali Khan, Ritesh Deshmukh, and Ram Kapoor, and despite their umpteen attempts, the three talents simply cannot salvage the crumbling ruins around them. Even more shameful is the fact that Khan seems to explore new territories where he can turn his actors into mere caricatures of themselves – scenes where Saif and Ritesh act up as insane canines and Ram Kapoor masquerading as a woman are unbearable to the point of being cringe-worthy. Heck, he even dresses up Ram Kapoor in a one-piece bikini! Which normal human being with his senses in the right place would ever do that? It's not just moronic, it's unethical! The less said about how the actresses are blatantly underutilized through the slipshod, inane proceedings, the better."Humshakals" seems to have rung the death knell on Sajid Khan's directing career, and only a miracle would seem him emerge from the ashes he has smoldered himself into. On a parting note, there a scene in the movie where Satish Shah, who plays the totalitarian warden of an asylum ward (Shah takes pride and displays an overt love for some of history's most notorious dictators such as Hitler, Saddam, Amin, and Gadaffi – one instance among the film's many tasteless and insensitive jokes), tortures dissenting inmates by forcefully making them sit through a copy of Sajid Khan's own "Himmatwala". Well, suffice to say, Khan has even outdone himself this time as far as competing from behind goes." 
" Not up to the mark looking at the lead like Saif Ali Khan","Sajid Khan directed 'Humshakals' only brings out one feeling to your heart , "How bad can a movie get !". This awful movie spoils your day in its 159 minutes of its running time. The movie is about these 2 men Ashok and Kumar , once again trying to repeat old humor by repeating names of legends of the Hindi film industry , who come into the trap of Ashok's uncle , Kuvar who wants to acquire his business empire and manages to send the both of them to a mental asylum. Over there where 2 actual mental twins of Ashok and Kumar (having the same names as a coincidence) already exist. After which follows the typical 'Comedy of errors' with absolutely bizarre sequences throughout the movie. I personally do like Saif Ali Khan as an actor but this time he's got it completely wrong. There is a scene in the movie where Satish Shah tortures Saif and Riteish by showing them Sajid Khan's previous movie 'Himmatwala' , I would rather suggest him to just show the horrendous movie they have acted in themselves and the torture would be worse than 3rd degree. I'm going with a 1/10 for this movie , watch it only if you don't have a life." 
" it competes with Sajid Khan's Himmatwala for most disgusting movie ever made","Rating 1(Awful) out of 10 is still a compliment to this movie. Director must payback to audience for their wastage of time & money. it was declared flop on day 1 and then they started paid media to keep showing collections obviously fake to tease the audience.I even heard govt has called this a human made disaster and offering relief package to all those who watched it. so don't tear off your tickets in frustration, it will help you to get refund & relief package for the trauma audience have been through.for audience, its 9 times of trauma, 18 times of frustration, 27 times of anger, 36 times of money drain, 45 times of mental breakdown. its not comedy of errors but error in comedy. there are no jokes here but PJ(poor jokes). there is no single comic moment which enables your laughing sense and it applies to all 5-10 people you could find in theater.its advisable to watch at your own risk movie as its worse than suicide." 
" Worst Movie I have watched till now","This movie is much much more than awful. Poor story, poor acting and poor screenplay. Don't even think to watch it in theaters. I have watched every movie of Sajid Khan till now and I am a die hard fan of comedy but this movie serves no purpose neither it is a comedy nor it is just for time- pass purpose. Please Please I again request all-Don't Watch it.I don't know why Times of India has given in it a 3/5 rating. Doppelgangers abound in "Humshakals," Sajid Khan's latest celebration of crass stupidity, in which a billionaire businessman and his best bud try to fend off a villainous uncle's dastardly machinations — all amid the orchestrated chaos engendered by multiple lookalikes, each one more idiotic than the next. The problem is not the stretched improbability of the film's premise, or even the political incorrectness of its caricatured stereotypes (this is slapstick, after all), but rather that the actors fail to come off as funny in any of their incarnations. Even fans of Khan's bottom-of-the-barrel humor ("Housefull," "Housefull 2") might be put off by this tedious, witless outing, the pick's strong B.O. performance notwithstanding." 
" Makes 'Phir Hera Pheri' look like 'Citizen Kane'","There are no words to describe how bad this film is. I didn't believe the reviews and I didn't take people's advice not to watch it; I wish I had. In the first hour, the film barely elicited one chuckle-- the jokes are lame, some- directed at South Indians, gays, mentally disturbed people- are downright offensive and because the delivery is so bad, they almost can't be taken in jest. Jokes about the Holocaust may go un-noticed in India but are beyond the pale in most Western countries and someone of Saif Ali Khan's cultured background should have known better. The "let's shoot item numbers around famous London monuments" grates after a while and some of the choreography seems to be handled by a 7 year old. How this film even got made is a mystery given Saif Ali Khan has been responsible for some decent fare in the past. A terrible film and surely a career low for all involved." 
" Why the hell they even think about to made it.","First I want to say that if there was zero for rating that will be right choice for this movie. Its complete senseless movie. In first 15 minute you will understand that its waste of time. I watched it completely so I can write a review. From the beginning for the plot of movie there is nothing. and by far you will see Director's adds in the script whatever he want it doesn't matter if its fit to the script or not. As story goes further more you will find the what the hell is going on ? I don't understand why Sajid Khan made this movie. Its complete crap. Director thinks that he can make audience fool. If peoples go to watch after watching the review of this then he can understand that times have been changed. and we are not that mad that waste on money on crap like this.Saif Ali Khan, Ritesh Deshmukh, Ram Kapoor they all did pretty disappoint job in this movie. In fact in whole movie you won't be able to see any acting at all, they all are just laughing in the whole movie.Other then Saif Ali Khan there was no big name in this movie but still people pay to watch good work and comedy and they disappointed by it. Sajid Khan did't even work on script. and I don't understand that why the hell Saif accept this script after read it.I think after cocktail he thinks that he can do anything. But the reason for success of Cocktail was Deepika Padukone. After that he was in Race2 that was not even close to Cocktail.Its time when Saif should think before taking any offer.And Sajid please stop making these nonsense movies.And finally if you still want to watch this crap then god help you!!!" 
" Humshakals is pretty much the worst film I have ever seen","humshakals is the lowest form of buffoonery I have seen this year. It would have been way more harsh if Ram & Riteish were missing from the film. Loaded with indecipherable dim wit, the film is an odd mishmash of pathos and drudgery. Unfunny and strictly for juvenile, I am gonna take the day off to decide whether Himmatwala was better than this. Meanwhile, stick to FIFA and stay away from the cinemas.Saif Ali Khan hasn't delivered this lusterless performance in a while. I haven't been a fan of his latest releases but the guy hams, overacts and is darn terrible at it. Pitted against better actors like Ram and Riteish doesn't help him as they make him look worse.Going with a very lenient 1.5/5, I am on the brink of lunacy after watching some glop like this."
