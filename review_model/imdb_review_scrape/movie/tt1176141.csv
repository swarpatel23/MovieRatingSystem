" Mithun is evil and scary","After more than a million flops Mithun made some disasters. His team with Aabha Films was good until there last movie which was Zehereela. This is Raj Sippy's second remake of the classic Cape Fear. Here, Mithun was the antagonist, he likes to trap girls with lovely words and then torture and rape them. Mithun made me scared, if I was in this movie I would freak out because of his evil acting. The story was good, Mithun's acting was the best but the editing was bad so the story becomes bad. Raj Sippy is a disgrace to the Sippy family, whatever movie he made alone in the 90's were all Atom Bombs except for Thanedaar."
