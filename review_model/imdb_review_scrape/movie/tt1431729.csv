" Excellent","I may not be a professional film critic but i am an movie enthusiast. I like to watch various kinds of movies. This film is really very exceptional and the way it's conveys its message is superb. I personally feel this type of movies must be seen by Indian audience to get mature. But really sorry to say that due to lack of promotion this kinds of films never get too far. If i could do a single thing to promote this film, i could've done that and that's why i am writing this review. I should suggest every Indian citizen to see this movie so they can have a clear picture of what our INDEPENDENT India is becoming now.Superb storytelling capability, beautiful cinematography and flow of the movie is the key points of this movie. Three cheers to the director.Only one thing i can say, movie like this is really a treasure to the movie industry." 
" I saw this movie on 15th August,the independence day of India and watching this movie made me realize......what kind of freedom we have?.......","India is a very peculiar country where corruption is increasing with development of country, there is a corrupt system working behind every thing.One cannot become a government officer until you have sufficient money to give bribes to officials and ministers,at the end of day your knowledge and education doesn't count, only thing that really matter is money. So it has became a system in which only a corrupt get flourished and honest man left to struggle until one day he also become a part of this system. Now it's roots reached so deep that it has became the acceptable part of society, taking and giving of bribe has became like a ritual which is performed before starting every work like opening shop, getting a tender, getting a government job and even if you have to open a school or orphanage you have to give large amount of bribe.As a result, a poor became more poor and a rich became more rich.This is an eyeopening drama about the struggle of a honest man Mohandas against the corrupt system spread in modern India. Mohandas who came from a very poor family become educated and after a long struggle he get the job, but he get shocked when he find out that another man was appointed for the post under his name,due to which Mohandas forced to do labor-work to earn living. This movie tells the story of Mohandas' struggle for justice and few other brave peoples who fought for a lost cause.The most striking thing in the movie was how the character of Mohandas was shown,with the expressions of a defeated man, completely hopeless. Many may found this very inappropriate but this expressions can be seen in youths of India who have lost all hopes. The character name was chosen Mohandas because it was the first name of father of nation Mohandas Karamchandra Gandhi or Mahatma Gandhi to make us realize that this country has gone far away to the wrong direction from the dreams of Mahatma Gandhi. Only few people dare to stand against the corruption ,only to get crushed by the system and this is what shown in the movie. This movie doesn't fill us with false hope but instead make us familiar with reality.The direction of Mazhar Kamran is brilliant and there was not a single moment in the movie where movie deviated from it's purpose (except songs), the storytelling of the movie is excellent that makes the movie very interesting, casting was full of talented actors like Govind Namdeo, Shushank Singh and Nakul Vaid.Story is written by journalist Uday Prakash and it is very clear that a deep research has been done before writing the story.Editing,sound and cinematography of the movie are also remarkable,considering the low budget of movie.The only thing that i can complain about are songs,there was no need to put songs in this movie,they didn't fit in the purpose of the movie.It is very unfortunate that such brilliant movies are rarely made in India but when they made they remained unnoticed due to the lack of promotion." 
" masterpiece","One of the most masterpiece of bollywood , this type of film can make only by FTIIn .
yes I can say premchand aaj bhi jinda hai" 
" Thought-Provoking At Every Point. â™¦ 72%","Never have I heard of this movie in my 4 years as a film aficionado, but after watching it, it has to be termed one of the many forgotten films of Bollywood.Just because it doesn't have known faces as actors doesn't mean the cast is bad. In fact, along with Sonali Kulkarni & others, the cast turns out to be perfect for the film. Although they were not properly directed, the plot does strike a couple of chords. Investing in lots of research, the writers tell the story of a person named Mohandas whose identity has been stolen in order to make benefit the mafia of UP. It starts with suspense and when the story advances, we think of our judicial system.How grave the loopholes of our system are that one can steal a person's identity and live an affluent life? This film notifies us about the system, the democracy and the judiciary. The characters are nicely written and since it samples real life occurrences, I give it a 7.2 out of 10.With a shabby cinematography & poor editing, it is not a classic but a sure winner. A must watch!BOTTOM LINE: Recommended!Profanity/Violence: Strong"
