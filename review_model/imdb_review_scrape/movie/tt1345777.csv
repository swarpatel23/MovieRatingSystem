" Romanticism amidst crime","Ishqiya tells the story of two petty thieves and one young and strong-minded widow. It is a crime thriller cum love triangle and it's rather satirical throughout. It is written by two talents, Vishal Bhardwaj and Abhishek Chaubey, who had previously scripted together such great movies as Omkara and Kaminey, only that this time the one who directs this feature is not Bhardwaj, but Chaubey, who was his assistant. The movie is set in a rustic village in Uttar Pardesh, and Chaubey skillfully captures the atmosphere of this wild rural region. The strength of this film lies in the twisted and multi-layered script and the rather serene narrative style which is flavoured by soulful musical numbers and a touch of dark humour. The witty and well-honed dialogues, the sophisticated camera work, the colourful characters, and the breathtaking cinematography, give the film an engagingly suspenseful yet authentic feel. Ishqiya is highly unpredictable thanks to the many underlying secrets it contains, and they are revealed in very surprising turns, which are more of puzzle pieces. In the meanwhile it gives the audience a chance to watch a true triangular love story, which is brought out on in an ironic sort of way.That's what makes it an overall enjoyable piece, and it certainly would not have been possible without the film's three leads. It is Vidya Balan who stands out and steals every single of her scenes in her restrained and understated portrayal of the mysterious, highly appealing, deeply yet quietly tormented Krishna. Her presence alone says it all, at times so much that her words are not as needed. Her wordless expressions convey so much of her essence that her true feelings and inner devastation are easily uncovered. Not to forget that she looks smashing hot in her traditional and simple looks, which is only aided by the cryptic screen persona she creates. Both Naseeruddin Shah and Arshad Warsi play their roles convincingly, and Salman Shahid provides good support in a negative comic role. Ishqiya feels very much a Vishal Bhardwaj film, and well, he is also the film's producer and music director. The soundtrack is a treat and the songs give life to the film, with such numbers as "Dil To Bachcha Hai" enhancing the narrative. The ending lets the viewers make their own conclusions, but I still wish there was some catharsis, which never came. Anyway, Ishqiya is overall an entertaining film, so I recommend." 
" A wry, witty, rustic love story at its best...","Arshad looks incredulously at the boy in front of him. "Tu Kaise Jaanta Hai Itna Saara Hathyaron Ke Bare Main?". The boy, deadpan, with no suggestion of humour, responds "Yahan Pe Chuttad Dhone Se Pehle, Tamancha Chalana Sikhate Hain". Welcome to a madcap roller coaster ride through a world that most Indian Netizens are not very familiar with, the India that we've kind of forgotten exists, the badlands of UP and its small villages, their on-going caste wars, con-men and utter lawlessness. Using the colourful, invective laced language that characterises the region, it proceeds to poke fun at the madness that passes for everyday life in most such places. And it simultaneously makes us laugh and think, to feel for characters so nicely etched that we cheer even when they're breaking the law.Arshad & Naseer, Mama and Bhanja, both con-men, are on the run from Naseer's Jijaji, for what exactly we're not sure but it involves some money and some ice. Due to a mix of circumstances which include an unwanted pregnancy and a jail term, they land up at the home of one of their ex-cell-mates, who it turns out has expired, leaving behind his widow, Vidya Balan. Unsure and hesitantly at first, Naseer & later Arshad develop feelings for our spunky but quiet lady. However, the Jija returns. And then the game heats upThe situations and characters that we encounter are beautifully drawn. The sense of humour or wry perspective that we're offered, remains intact through the film. The dialogue is witty and makes you chuckle non-stop. And the songs, the background music is of exceptional quality. Right from the number of classics liberally laced in different situations (Dhanno Ki Aankhon Main, Pyaar Ka Surma at a brothel, Ae Meri Zohra Jabeen as a ringtone for the Jija) or the semi-classical song that Vidya sings in the beginning or the two flagship songs the zany, peppy 'Ibn Batuta' or the lyrical, romantic 'Dil to Bacha Hai', after a long time in a Hindi film, it was worth the price of a ticket just to see the songs. Arshad Warsi and Vidya Balan light up the screen with their effervescent performances, while Naseeruddin Shah, true to his character remains the stable one. With his surma ringed eyes, ready wit, goofy grin, angry stare and lovable roguishness, Arshad delivers a performance we'd forgotten he was capable of. Vidya doesn't put a foot wrong, playing on the emotions of both the men like a taanpura, sad, melancholic at times and smiling, alluring, teasing at others. For both of them, this film will feature prominently on their CV for some time to come. And Vishal / Abhishek continue their knack of picking an ensemble cast that looks like they belong to the villageseach of the characters we meet look comfortably at home in their rural setting. more on this film, incl several dialogue references at ApurvBollywood at blogspot, here it shows up as spelling errors. You must watch this film !" 
" Delicious saucy comedy and a suspenseful noir!!","When I entered the movie hall to watch ishqiya i had a feeling of deja vu !! I thought it would be very similar to omkara but NO! it ain't omkara.. The only thing similar in both movies is the village!! Debutant Abhishek Chaubey wastes no time in setting up his drama, throwing you into the story immediately, never wasting more time on unnecessary links.Ishqiya is pure delight.. Both in terms of the narrative that moves from one tangy twist to another and in terms of the performances.. The film's USP is its lingo and witty dialogues which keep you tickling all the time! Added to that the biggest star of the movie is the script per se! Set in the village of gorakhpur ishqiya deals with two small gangsters Arshad and Naseeruddin who with vidya balan make a plan to kidnap a small businessman to earn money and return to the head! But then the thing which will blow you away is the chemistry between the trio!(Arshad Naseer & Vidya) Arshad with his great comic timimg and abusive dialogues will win numerous accolades! Naseeruddin Shah is the legend as everyone knows but in this film he shines in a great manner in his romantic scenes with vidya!And of course Vidya Balan oh what a performance she has given in this film! She has carried away a widow woman full of vengeance in a superb way..The climax of the movie is fast paced and is full of twists and turns but the scenes between Arshad and Vidya are hilarious! Go have a blast!My Rating 8/10 Thanks and Regards.." 
" Raw & Rustic",""Ishqiya" is not for the entire spectrum of audience. For those who have relished "Maqbool", "Omkara", "Dev D", "Kaminey" and were left begging for more, welcome aboard. Your prayers have been answered.Make no mistake - each frame exuberates passion. Its precise, planned, researched, and executed. Each dialogue and each emotion depicts creative juices. "Youth has the luxury to see thing in black and white, as we mature everything is grey". Indian Cinema has had long stint of black & white characters, its overwhelming to see the maturity and grey characters being fleshed out effectively. Every character even if appears for a small stint has a purpose in the movie and the loose ends get tied up towards the finale.☼ Naseeruddin Shah:: I am at loss of words for somebody who is an epitome of acting personified. As Big B rightly acknowledged "When Naseeruddin Shah speaks, you simply bow your head and listen". Every scene of Naseer is nothing short of sheen of gold, pure gold.☼ Vidya Balan:: Now these are the kind of movies, Vidya Balan should be choosing. She manages to carve her identity inspite of being pitted opposite Naseeruddin Shah. In the nutshell, she manages to culminate the intensity of both Shabana Azmi and Smita Patil. When Naseer & Arshad sort things out (read that "wash dirty linen in public") it reminded me "Women and money are the greatest dividers". Nonetheless, her character is one of the best in recent years.☼ Arshad Warsi:: Even though his character gets a low footing compared to Naseer and Vidya, Arshad recycles his Circuit character from Munnabhai and leave a mark as Babban. If Naseeruddin Shah's character personified a seeker of love, Arshad Warsi is balanced with lust overdrive.☼ Salman Shahid:: I had my brain racking trying to recall the familiar deep baritone voice of this actor. He stood out in "Kabul Express" and its good to see him again.The sweet voice of Rahat Fateh Ali Khan lingers on the head for a while in his rendition of "Dil Toh Baccha Hain Jee". Thanks to mystical words of Gulzar and wonderful composition by Vishal.Finally the director qualifies his entry into the league of the Dream Mechants with aplomb. Abhishek Chaubey, take a bow.After "Ishqiya", you will be waiting with bated breath for something similar to come up and satiate your cravings. Undoubtedly this qualifies one of the best movie of 2010, at least in my wish-list.PS: I'd do anything for love (Meatloaf). It's a love story, yes!" 
" Thoroughly entertaining!","From the film making house of Vishal Bhardwaj comes a fresh and most promising talent of Abhishek Chaubey who combines the best from his senior with his own slick raw style to give us 'Ishqiya'. The tremendously talented Naseeruddin Shah plays Khalujaan, joining forces with the comic and astute Babban (Arshad Warsi) to play the notorious duo of Mama-Bhanja who are on the run from Mushtaq (Salman Shahid). Their desperate search for associate goons brings them to Verma's widow, Krishna (Vidya Balan) with whom they are entrapped in a game of lust, lure, deceit, treachery and suspense. 'Ishqiya' is thoroughly enjoyable with the right amount of humour, suspense, sex appeal and some wonderful music. Khalujaan and Babban have embarked on a dangerous journey into Gorakhpur (U.P.) where the entertainment and thrill comes from the people. While the deadline to repay Mushtaq's debt looms over them, the attraction of Krishna and the yearning for freedom ensures their digression. A risky kidnapping of a millionaire was their desperate attempt of getting the quick money that would buy their freedom but little did they know what fate awaits them. The plot is not outlandish at all. In fact, the writing is the strength of this film. Vishal Bhardwaj's story and screenplay ensure total capacity utilization of such immense talents in the film. Vidya Balan is outstanding and her recent films prove her capabilities without any requirement for contemporary glamour. She looks beautiful in every scene and her character's traits are easily depicted through her expression. Arshad Warsi has finally bagged a role where he can explore his versatility and strength. He has wasted the years after the Munnabhai series doing some unworthy films. Naseeruddin Shah's aura of excellence can go unnoticed because you only see Khalujaan in the film. It only hits you at a later point that it was all an act. Vishal Bhardwaj's music and Gulzar's lyrics work magically yet again. Rahat Fateh Ali Khan's superb rendition of Dil toh bachcha has the perfect blend of soothing music and rich lyrics that make it the song that will linger in your head for a long time. Ibn-e-batuta is also a very catchy song with Sukhwinder Singh and Mika adding their distinct punch to it. Abhishek has perfectly placed the songs in situations where the lyrics take the story forward. His direction keeps the pace at a very comfortable level with enough humour packed in to make it a joy ride. The new gen of directors will now adorn their hats with one more feather for 'Ishqiya', a wholesome entertainer. 8.33 on a scale of 1-10." 
" Ishqiya is special !!","There are many among the new 'cool' generation, who use Desi as a derogatory term in their conversations. Thanks to Vishal Bhardwaj, Desi is the new cool :). Some Bollywood lovers call him Quentin Tarantino of Bollywood, which I fail to understand. Without any disrespect to him and his fans, i would say that I have not seen a lot of Tarantino's work, so i do not know care who he is. However, if we are comparing Vishal Bhardwaj with him, he has to be good :) Having said that, this post is not about Vishal Bhardwaj and he has not directed Ishqiya. It is directed by his protegé Abhishek Chaubey, who does not deny that the movie has Vishal Bhardwaj stamp on it. If you have any doubts about the debuting director's potential, the first few scenes in the movie will answer all of them.The starting scene of the movie tells a lot about the competent director. The main protagonist of the movie will get you hooked right from this very first scene. You will instantly come to know that you are watching something special. Everything from the sets, costumes, mannerisms and language is so refreshingly different and I am not talking about the much talked about abuses. Yes, abuses are there but they are just a small prop in a large structure. The still water, holy cows, grasslands, dusty roads, glowing eyes of the villagers are captured beautifully. The rustic visuals create an old world charm throughout the movie.There is no dull moment in the movie. It moves at a brisk pace with smooth transition from one scene to another largely because of the crisp writing. The dialogues are quirky and witty at the same times. That is the most fabulous part of the script. The wit in the dialogues is not forced to put some light humor,it is there because the situation is like that. No one is trying to tell a joke (apart from one latifa as the last wish before death :D) and there are no caricature like comic characters.Dialogues are witty but they have deep meanings also. It is a very deadly combination to have. Watch out for the one liners on sexism, caste-ism and such wide-ranging topics. I am really inclined to give some examples, but I do not want to add spoilers here. The director touches the most sensitive topics affecting our country like naxalism, law and order, fanaticism in the deepest of manners with just few one liners here and there. And the beauty of all this is, you will be giggling on those dialogues. What audacity !! One of the things which makes the movie hugely enjoyable is its music. We all know what happens when Vishal Bhardwaj and Gulzar combine for an album. The starting scene which i mentioned earlier has Vidya balan humming the song Ab mujhe koi intezaar kahan which is sensual in its unique way. Ibn-E-Batuta kicks the start credits with lot of chutzpah and élan. Then there is a classical song in melodious voice of Rekha Bhardwaj, this is exactly the kind of song we do not hear that often in our movies and yearn for those. And then comes the song of the album, i would dare say that this is the song of the year (i know it is just January .. but still) Dil to bachha hai Ji. What a song, what a fantastic piece of art !! , I think it is one of those songs that will remain in the pubic memory for a long long time. The background score is just about perfect for a thriller. And yes, the use of the songs from the past, which i think is Vishal Bhardwaj way of giving tribute to the Classics is incorporated to elevate the impact of the scenes to another level.The kind of movie Ishqiya is, it relies heavily on performances. And that is where the casting team of the movie scores the brownie points. Every character fits the part to the T. Right from the child artist to the old woman with the torch have a sense of participation in carrying forward the movie. The goofy don played by Salman Shahid makes us laugh without making any apparent effort towards doing so. Coming to the lead trio, There is no doubt that Arshad Warsi is one of the most underutilized actors in Bollywood. He has really side-splitting lines and he delivers them with aplomb. It is time that the industry gives him the roles, which he is worthy of. Naseeruddin Shah expresses every characteristic of an aging man who falls for a young woman so wonderfully that the viewer almost tends to believe that he has a genuine chance against his younger competitor :). You have to just watch his expressions of his likeness for Krishnaji and the way he tries to woo her is so endearing. Vidya Balan is playing a character which requires her to look madly in love, vulnerable & helpless yet tough & menacing, epitome of grace yet wild & seductive. And at times the camera just had to focus on her face and she manages to express all those wide-ranging emotions without uttering a word ! If this is not class, tell me what is? I just wish she makes the right moves; She has all the ingredients of becoming an all time great.Ishqiya is the true Indian movie. It celebrates the rural heartlands of India with lot of spunk and style. The only complain i have with Ishqiya is that it ends too soon :) Team Ishqiya, take a bow !!" 
" Fantastic Film!","This is what a good movie is all about - The authentic setting of village life with beautiful cinematography, the 3 main starts were perfect - I for one could not picture any other actress alive in Hindi cinema that could have delivered the role what Vidya played. Everything could be read from her emotions without her saying anything.You know how good a film is when you can read and feel each character as they interact with each other - almost as good as a book.Without spoiling the film I urge everyone to watch this gem and really do wish it wins awards it deserves. Hindi cinema needs to embrace these new type of film styles - were all fed up with rich brats in foreign lands scenario. Hope YC and KJ are taking a note from these clever films - you don't need mega stars or million dollar budgets to produce a film.Whats refreshing is most people who have posted a review have said similar things. So I am glad I am not alone when I think Hindi Cinema needs to encourage directors/writers that produce films like these.9/10" 
" Admire Omkara.. go for Ishqiya","In Omkara, Vishal Bhardwaj sets such a high standard for him self that Kamine even though good enough by typical bollywood standard disappointed many. But here comes Ishqiya, almost matches Omkara blow by blow. Directed by a débutant Abhishek Chaubey, Ishqiya is a story shown with a wonderful euphoria. And did I mention you that it has set appealing good standard for comedy too? Crisp script with proper blend of suspense and humor and on top of that ultimate cast selection makes sure nothing goes wrong. Every actor is given role what he is best suited for and in what he regards as best in bollywood. No need to say about class performance of Naseeruddin shah, and can any one match Arshad Warsi in on the spot comedy? Vidhya Balan suits so much in the role that you forget that you are seeing an actress from glamor world of bollywood.If you admire Omkara's genre, it is worth to watch Ishqiya. 8/10." 
" Well intentioned but hurriedly delivered; good acting & songs!","Movie Review: Ishqiya (Hindi) 107If the promos were to be believed, this could have been one of the best made movies of the year. Who could predict that a movie that starred the immensely talented Naseeruddin Shah, Vidya Balan and Arshad Warsi along with the 'Vishal Bharadwaj' tag could only turn into a movie which you would call nothing more than 'Okay, decent'. Nevertheless, as music adds much needed spice, it's still worth your money!The film opens with Krishna (Balan) in bed with husband Vidyadhar Verma in playful pillow-talk. As Krishna addresses Verma as 'Jahaanpanah' on screen, the audience was quick to append it with 'tussi great ho'; remember "3 Idiots" anyone? Cut to next scene, a blast. Cut again to Khalujaan (Shah) and Babban (Warsi) fleeing with stolen money seeking refuge at the now widow Krishna's village home near Gorakhpur. The story builds on as Krishna unleashes her femme fatale charms to tame the duo to toe her line. Vidya Balan playing her part to perfection uses her 'desi' sensuality to the fullest while also displaying shades of bravado firing the shotgun when needed. As with Vishal Bhadwaj's movies, Ishqiya too has a rustic setting, foul mouthed characters and a hinterland heart. This flick deals with Kidnapping near the Nepalese border.By interval time, the narrative just warms up enough to suggest that the trio now plan to kidnap a rich businessman for ransom. Khalu and Babban jump into agreement, given that their booty stands stolen and has to be repaid while on the other, they're taken over by lust and love for Krishna who manipulates their passions, so much so that Khalu junks his old lover's photo & Babban ditches his pal to make love to her.The film-makers may have planned their hard-sell on the plank that Krishna's role is in shades of grey. Femme fatales have done well for themselves all through history, be it Cleopatra, or in Bollywood, "Karz" or "Aitraaz". But expectations fall flat towards the end as Krishna turns into nothing more than the clichéd vengeful Indian wife. Well, being apologetic was the last thing that one could expect out of a Vishal Bhardwaj film. Making things worse is the hurried rush of scenes towards the end; as if a student just realized that he only ten minutes left with half the paper still to go. Climax is contrived and destroys the original 'femme fatale in grey' thread. But, its brilliant songs such as Rahat Fateh Ali khan rendition 'Dil to Bachcha Hai' and Singhs Sukhwinder & Mika's 'Ibn- E-Batuta' work like a balm. Try it out and you won't regret watching it." 
" An example of brilliant film making!!!","Ishqiya 9/10 After a long time an Indian movie achieves the status of a perfect thriller. This is a milestone history of Hindi cinema.The story is very twisted and with every scene it opens up a bit more. You'll be guessing a lot of things but I can bet that till the end of movie you will still be guessing what and why are all these happening.Let me tell you, all events, actions, scenes, dialogs are important in this movie. If you miss even one frame your questions will be unanswered. Really this is a piece of art. I'm still clueless about a few things.Screenplay: 9/10. Good. If told in any other format, it would have looked so predictable that you could write the whole story from the beginning scene.Cinematography: Beautiful, captures a few good frames on village life. No unnecessary top shots, close ups, framing etc. Every scene is so well rehearsed, well prepared that they stand alone for praise.Dialogs: Whoa. This is the real asset of this movie. In your face dialog. No mercy, no hiding, total raw emotions comes out through dialog. Hats off to whoever wrote it.Acting: Vidya Balan has just washed out all others. Wow!!! She reminded me the actress from "Straw Dogs", doing something, telling something, thinking something and wishing something else...all at same time. Kudos to this girl. She simply rocked. Then comes Naseeruddin and Arshad, marvelous in their part. I want to say that everyone acted brilliantly, even that "nani" Directing: Man, bringing out this kind of believable acting from each and everyone of your crew is not easy. You need to have a clear idea about what exactly you want from this scene, what this frame should look like. Even if you are disgusted how you show your emotions....hats off to Abhishek Chaubey. Really looking forward to more from him.Songs: Now, what more should I tell. Everyone is singing "Dil to bachha hai ji", its a gr8 romantic track in recent times. All other songs are so nicely blended in the movie that you won't feel their presence at all.IMO, I rate it better than Kaminey. Kaminey became very predictable at the last hour. But this is way above all. Very very recommended to all" 
" Its cunningly rustic and made with the clear intention of strengthening the Indian Tarantino Movement started by Vishal Bhardwaj.","Vishal Bhardwaj initiated his offbeat Tarantino style movement in India with the much acclaimed "Maqbool" which also had many commercial elements incorporated in it. But with "Omkara" & "Kaminey" he revealed his clear intentions of following a different path altogether on the similar lines of Quentin Tarantino & Guy Richie kind of cinema. And with "Ishqiya" directed by his associate Abhishek Chaubey, Vishal comes up with another movie contributing in the said movement following the same formula of surprising the audiences with its realistic characters, on-screen abuses, bold language and expressive sexual sequences.In real terms, "Ishqiya" straight away won over the viewers before its release, with its brilliantly compiled, earthy and sexual promos supported by few well composed songs, just as "Kaminey" did a few months ago. But as seen in the case of "Kaminey", due to some major serious issues, "Ishqiya" may also witness a divided box office result between its critical acclaim and the actual universal response in the coming weeks.The movie revolves around the story of two con-men who are running to save their lives from their boss and find shelter in the house of a young and attractive widow. During their extended stay, the lady starts flirting with both the men, as she has a hidden agenda to get a task done by the two, which is revealed to the viewers after a good one hour in the film. So, "Ishqiya" does have an intelligently chosen and interesting story plot, told in an amusing style with some soothing and melodious songs to enjoy. And no doubt, it's well directed by the debutant director Abhishek Chaubey who never gives you any glimpse of a first time project.But the main drawback in the movie is that its starts too slow and picks up too late. In fact it actually starts coming to the point just before the intermission and till then the viewer desperately keeps waiting for something explosive to happen on the screen as expected. Surprisingly, the real interesting plot of planning the kidnapping of a rich industrialist starts right after the interval. In other words the film shows everything in store for the viewer only post intermission and that too in such a hurried pace which further leads to many confusions and chaos towards the climax. The love triangle plot in the script, left with an open end in the last scene, also may find less takers among the viewers in the smaller centers.However, the best part of the movie remains its performances, where every character enacts his part in a highly realistic and amusing way with just the right lingo, style and attire. Naseeruddin Shah gives a splendid performance as a lonely one sided lover and impresses the most. Arshad Warsi is simply brilliant with his earthy language and freaking out style. Vidya Balan once again delivers a winning act after "Paa". She also dares to give her most intimate kissing scene on the screen with Arshad which is a well directed one too. The rest of the cast is also a treat to watch with everyone playing their parts with sheer conviction.Musically, it has a great soundtrack to enjoy with gems like "Ibne Batuta" and "Dil To Bachha Hai Re" in the incomparable style of Vishal Bhardwaj and Gulzar together as a team. Still, I felt the song picutrisation could have been better at some places. Cinematography adds value to the project and the overall earthy look of the movie has been well worked upon.But the project leaves many questions unanswered such as: 1. Why the movie was promoted as a Vulgar Language flick when there are hardly any dialogues (very few) of such sort? 2. Why it was projected as a witty and interesting comic venture when in fact it was not a comedy but a dark and slow crime thriller? 3. Why the actual interesting kidnapping plot starts after the intermission, where as the film has got nothing great to showcase in its first hour? 4. Has Vishal Bhardwaj decided that all his produced or directed films will always have a pre- release hype dependent on vulgarity, abusive language and sexual scenes?In short, if you are expecting to see a highly entertaining or light comic movie as projected by the well designed promos of the movie then you are sure going to be disappointed to a great extent. All the humorous and enjoyable comical scenes which were there in the promos of "Ishqiya" are scattered here and there in the film which fail to generate a collective entertaining impact as seen in the 3 minute trailer of the movie before its release. On the contrary it's a slow paced and dark thriller which will surely get appreciation from the section of viewers who loved Vishal's "Kaminey". But a unanimous appreciation from all the centers is quite questionable.To sum up, from a film-maker or film student point of view, "Ishqiya" is not perfect but still good work done. But from a common man's viewpoint, who is there in the theater to get entertained as promised by its trailer, the movie leaves him unattended." 
" Wish kiya... aur paya Ishqiya.","Brilliant trailers and amazing music had created some amount of hype for this movie... and Vishal Bhardwaj's name was just the icing on the cake.This film is divided into two parts: the part before interval, the one I call slow and OK, and the part AFTER the interval, the part I call... brilliant.Where to start... where to start... it's a slow start with a little shaky introduction, one that leaves us baffled, I mean... what just happened!? Then, the great duo comes in, and my my, what a performance by both! Special credit goes to Arshad Warsi for getting back his Munnabhai dialect. For a change, even Balan shone bright! As for the direction of the first half, it's good, but a person tends to get bored at times. I know I did. The whole plot isn't clear till about 40 minutes into the movie. Not a really convincing interval, but well... first part's over! And then comes the second. The movie suddenly picks up the pace and you find yourself engaged! A love triangle builds up amongst Shah, Warsi and Balan (Quote, Warsi: "Vah! Tera Ishq Ishq Hai, Mera Ishq sex."). The excitement grows and the one-liners ("Chutiyam Sulphate", "Chuttad Dhone Se Pehle Tancha Chalana Seekhte Hai")... and the way they're said, it's just BRILLIANT! Kudos to Abhihskek for a brilliant debut, and kudos to Vishal Bhardwaj for being the genius he is, the one-liners and music are amazing! For a change, good cinematography and good editing do their job as well. And that's why it rocks - because all basics are perfect.And, my my, what an end. What a beautiful end.Rating: First half: 7/10 Second half: 9/10 Overall: 8/10 (That's a **** guys!) Somehow, I just know only a small audience will like this wonder... somehow, I just do." 
" above average at best","I had big expectations.. from this movie. A couple of my friends also compared the style of the movie to a Bollywood equivalent of a Tarantino film. I DON'T THINK SO.The movie has some good songs i'll give you that. The story was fast - slow- draggingly slow- hurried again and it all ended with much to be delivered by the end. Naserudin has definitely been wasted here.. he could have done a much better job if the story/screenplay was executed properly. Arshad does good and Vidya Balan.. well what can I say she was OK.I'd have loved to see a better execution of this storyline with more emphasis on character building and a steady engrossing screenplay.6/10." 
" below expectations","2011 film awards for lyrics and critics' best actress award given to Vidya Balan for this movie, had raised the expectations of seeing this movie, reminding one of Vishl Bhardwaj's earlier movie 'Omkara', but this movie did not live up to his earlier movie's expectation of having a good storyline. Nevertheless one is satisfied to see the typical rustic lifestyle of Bihar as earlier seen in movies like Omkara, Apaharan etc, here again Vidya Balan's looks and clothes seemed to be too sophisticated for a rustic rural life in Bihar, as compared to the other two male characters Naseerudin Shah and Arshad Warshi, who looked and acted very real. Movie was not as engrossing and one can easily remove it from one's Must-see-list." 
" I could not comprehend it exactly due to incompetence to interpret a film that does not have much novelty but in dialect and backdrop.","I could not comprehend it exactly due to incompetence to interpret a film that does not have much novelty but in dialect and backdrop.On the first look of trailers, I was awestruck and happy. Also, I suspected that it was a faithful remake of 'Butch Cassidy and The Sundance Kid' but this is just an inspiration to a limited extent. It's layered with Desi Commercial elements to make a typical bollywood pot boiler and that's when it turns out to be plot fouler. The flaw is not in the script/screenplay but in trying to make it commercial and convey something out of nothing. Two goons escape death each time they are caught and are never killed. They escape it once and then fall into the lap of a widow when they try to cross the border and this is when things start to happen.It's a deliberation from writer to make all the threads knit to take it to that end which he has very much pre planned and only the way it's done is to be shown. Only twist is that when I did expect someone to die, someone else did die and it was silly. A old woman (what connection she has to the plot is abstract) triggers a fire. And in this deliberation lay the backlog of the entire script coz right from the beginning it was evident that things were slowly going to that end which has no poignancy or a point.Well, there is no problem with pointless movies but they did move me / engage me or did something to me but this worse coz it left me pale in most parts and in parts where there were witty dialogues it did make me smile else it was a boring thing for 2 hours. If having a novel dialect and putting some scoldings and just knitting some threads to make a script would work then anyone can write and anyone can work crap. Despite, being an admirer of Vishal Baharadwaj who produced this piece, I not only condemn this but discourage such movies from being made.Please add some sense in trying to make a different original movie. It's just good for acting, dialogue and cinematography. It's just average as a whole 2/5." 
" Well-Made, but caters to a niche audience...","Abhishek Chaubey directed 'Ishqiya' is a well-made film in all respects, but it's a film that caters to a niche audience. Sure it has an interesting storyline, but it's take on it is very different. This one is a rustic, abusive, violent & complicated film at the end of the day.'Ishqiya' has a okay first hr, a terrific second, but a weak end. The climax is not as impactful as one wonders and expects. The twist in the end is also not convincing, it looks made-up, it's bland to be honest. 'Ishqiya' earned amazing critical acclaim, but only average success at the box office, Now I know why!Chaubey's direction is apt, Vishal Bhardwaj's dialog are in complete sink with the film. His music is fantastic, 'Dil Toh Bachcha Hai Ji' is a lovely track. In the acting department, Naseeruddin Shah is simply superb, he's a matchless performer! Arshad can't stand his feet near Naseer. Vidya Balan is terrific, playing here part with dynamic ease. The actor who plays Vidya's husband is strictly okay. 'Ishqiya' is a must watch for those who are tired of watching simply entertainers, as this one is meant for that section of audience."
