" Akshay is finally back !","Before going into the theater,I didn't expect much because the trailer seemed senseless and... since Akshay's previous scores were terrible in Action Replayy,Tees Maar Khan,Patiala House and Thank You,I remained hopeless. But WOW.The movie was more like a surprise. The chemistry between Akshay and John is excellent.Jokes were hilarious.Some flaws in directing.Concerning music,Pritam builds up a good tempo in 'Make some noise for Desi Boyz' and carries the fun promisingly with Jhak Maar Ke and Tu Mera Hero with an all-together new breed and genre of music.The whole movie is a laughter pack for everyone and it is one of the best comedies of 2011.Don't miss this,Highly Recommended !" 
" Most entertaining movie of the year","Desi Boyz is a great entertainer whether you like it or not it is a great time pass flick.Performances- Akshay is brilliant and his performance makes this a movie worth a watch. John - did a pretty good job the chemistry is brilliant between akshay and John. Deepika isn't that good and does alright job. Chitrangda Singh was pretty good. Cameos from sanjay dutt and anupam kher were good.Directing/Cinematography - The cinematography was above average nothing special. The directing wasn't bad, it was David Dhawans son who directed and as a first time director hes done a very good job, though there were 2 scenes copied from other movies, but its a pretty good job for a first timedirector.Songs/ Choreography- the songs were very catchy and nice in the movie and so were the dance movies.Script/plot - The plot isn't refreshingly new but still good. It has similarities to other movies but doesn't really copy.Comedy- the movie isn't hilarious but there are some laugh out loud moments in the movie and funny original jokes.overall - A funny and entertaining movie with great chemistry by akki and john definitively worth a watch if you're a fan of akshay or even john." 
" Great work akshay !!","Great movie Finally akshay and jhonny boy are back together...good to see them .. acting throughout the movie is very good ...akshay kumar is very good in this movie & also his paring with chitrangada singh ,jhon is back with same acting but over all a good act & looks great in this movie.i was waiting to see this movie finally was able to make it ... and must say that loved every movement of it,A must watch if u can relate your self with the story,which i was able to match up with akshay's life in the movie.. have to say the songs play a very very big part of the movie as well ... the emotional scenes in the movie was directed very well ..and was touching ..finally, the child and akshay share a good chemistry which makes u cry at some sences...must watch not only for time pass but also to enjoy and take home sweet memories of the movie ..... loved it !!!" 
" After a long time,a good comedy movie with a nice storyline","it is a nice movie.Its has laughters,good songs,good storyline and a different concept.The story is bit predictable.Comedy from starting to the end.sanjay dutt's and akshay's acting was awesome.Anupam kher is good too. The story is different. But who wants a story in a comedy movie.John and akshay's Basically movie is made for you to enjoy during the whole time. chemistry is too good.Akshay after a long time did good acting. the movie is about two best friends,who makes some mistakes,in the end they get themselves corrected.Characters like omi vaidya,anupam kher,sanjay dutt added more interest to the movie.Didn't expected so much fun from the movie.So,movie is definitely worth watching or i'll say its a must go for comedy lovers" 
" It's really an entertaining & worth watching comedy movie!","Akshay is back with his charm in Desi Boyz after giving flop movies like Tees Maar Khan, Action Replay, Patiyala House. Desi Boyz is probably the most entertaining comedy movie of the year. The Chemistry between Akshay and John is outstanding. Omi Vaidya is also very good in the movie. You will really enjoy the funny gags in the movie, especially gags with Ajay aka Omi Vaidya. Anupam Kher and Sanjay Dutt are also good. Glamour of Deepika Padukone and Chitrangada Singh is also charming. Story and Direction of the movie is good. Music is also good. Overall, it's an entertaining & worth watching comedy movie i recommend you to watch." 
" a movie with a fresh idea , concept and story","first of all guys in this movie you cant take your eyes off .the movie has strong content with drama and comedy or u can say Dramedy. Akshay Kumar was superb. and i think after Hera Pheri and Garam Masala it is strong performance by Akshay Kumar. John Abraham is now continuously improving his acting skills and this may be the best performance ever i had seen by John.in between movie the one man who steels the show is Sanjay Dutt. he is unbeatable in his typical role.and the best thing about the movie is Akshay Kumar not only done his typical comedy but you will see him as a outstanding acting in serious role. and Akshay is looking exceptionally handsome in this movie . Anupam Kher is also done a good job and Deepika acting is OK but after interval the gorgeous Chitrangada steals the show as a professor so guys if you miss this , you just missed the entertaining dose" 
" Watch it again... Jakh Maar Ke!!!","While the trailers suggested it to be another "Shout-it-out-loud" Akshay Kumar movie, it came up as a pleasant surprise. The punches were strong and the timing was right. The combination of Akshay Kumar and John works perfectly fine with the two hottesties of Bollywood not leaving any scope for anymore glamor. Some of the dialogs, you just won't forget (main 6 feet ka hoon aur tum 5 feet 8 inch ki lagti ho. we look great together). Kudos to the writer to effectively tying up the UK job losses issue with the story of the movie. Besides the four leads, commendable performances by Sanjay Dutt, Anupam Kher and the SILENCER (Omi Vaidya). After a long time, comes a movie from Akki which is worth second watch and I bet you will still LOL!!! Songs like Make some noise for the Desi Boyz, Jakh Maar Ke and Subah Hone Na De are just cheery on top.Definitely the best entertainer of the year and a must-watch for everyone." 
" Nice Feel Good Movie","At last akshay kumar got it right :) after series of awful movies (except patiala house) i had lost hope on him but what a nice way to come back with a bang :) Story and Direction - Story is not novel but direction by rohit dhawan is good considering it is his first movie. He has bright future as director.Performances - Akshay Kumar rocks man ! He has performed exceedingly well - comedy he does good as usual but it is emotional scenes - the one with child where he showcases his ability as actor ! John Abraham does well - although he need to improve his dancing skills which was ordinary ! Deepika Padukone was also good ! Chitrangda strikes in small role ! Anupam Kher was good ! Sanjay Dutt was show stealer - he was brilliant in his cameo ! The child who play Akshay's nephew was cute and did well ! Omi Vaidya irritates a lot ! Music - Music is highlight of the movie ! Desi Boyz title track and Allah Maaf kare are my favorites.Cinematography was good (locales of UK were beautiful). Editing was good though they could have cut down the court scene in climax which was too lengthy and slightly irritating.In Other Words, Desi Boyz is no classic but it is feel good movie - a nice entertainer 8/10." 
" One of the worst big budget attempts of 2011 with some good music.","Once I asked a friend of mine about his choice of career in the coming days. He was the son of a successful hotelier with two big hotels in the city. In answer to my question he replied, "From my heart, I want to do something related to books or publishing but if nothing works out then there is always my father's business to join in anytime".I just remembered his words after the end credits of DESI BOYZ started rolling with the caption - Directed by Rohit Dhawan (son of David Dhawan). The point I wish to make here is that it really seems to be very easy for a Star-Director's son to make his first hugely weak film with all the big stars, but how extremely difficult it is for a talented young director to get his first such directorial break without any family backing in the industry. And the film itself proves my point since it gives you only one question to think after its over that,. What was this?Written around the plot of two unemployed friends (Akshay & John), DESI BOYZ is a pretty bad attempt to make an enjoyable BHELPURI by putting so many elements into it which in-turn results in an utterly distasteful dish. It starts from talking about Recession and Unemployment leading to the profession of GIGOLO adopted by the two heroes. The concept of GIGOLO is only added to bring in some extra, controversial pull in the project as it is neither shown nor exploited properly in the film. In fact using the sex-plot in such a shying way is just like wishing to take a bath in the swimming pool without taking off your clothes.In addition, as a typical Bollywood film, an innocent kid and his judicial custody angle is thrown in, just to fulfill the emotional requirement of a Hindi Film which doesn't work at all. Another veteran senior (Sanjay Dutt) comes in a special appearance as the owner of that GIGOLO firm, degrading himself and his good image. A beautiful girl (Deepika) is right there like a sweet-item on the dinner table since you cannot make a Bollywood film without them. The girl even has a funny father (Anupam Kher) who fulfills the post of a supporting comedy artist with his reputed name. Further some silly jokes and hardly hilarious sequences are forcibly stuffed in its script to complete its first half which regrettably makes you take a look at your watch/phone at least 10 times.Post intermission DESI BOYZ goes worst from bad with many bizarre kind of inclusions like Akshay taking admission to a College in his over-age. To give him company he even has a lady professor (Chitrangdha) who luckily was his own classmate in the good old college days. So here comes another beautiful lady to entertain you with her great looks, good for nothing. On the other side of this college romance, John is busy pleasing his girl by taking a shelter in front of her house with the help of her funny father. And frankly you can easily fast forward or edit out this unwanted part of the movie as it has nothing to contribute or entertain in any manner whatsoever.To end it on an emotional note, a more weird kind of Courtroom scene is staged for the child's custody, wherein Sanjay Dutt enters as if its his own playground, gives a speech and then returns at his own will, while the honorable judge keeps waiting for him to come and go just like that. In the acting department, instead of commenting upon their performance I would humbly like to ask a few questions from the cast as given below:Akshay Kumar - Do you ever read the script of your movies and see the rushes midway to have an idea of what is being made around your reputed name for the countless fans? And Do you understand that we all are simply waiting for a BIG HIT coming from you from so long? John Abraham - Why did you do this film or Was your role edited out at a later stage? Because frankly you are simply doing nothing in the film as per your current status or fame.Deepika & Chitrangdha - The choice of project really doesn't match the off-screen intelligence and persona of both the ladies as they are not given much to do in the script apart from wearing some cool outfits. I had no great expectations from Deepika but 'Why you opted for this, Chitrangdha?', when you only had to enter post interval just to add some more glamour in the film or Was this also a shock for you after its release (The way they treated you in it)?Anupam Kher & Sanjay Dutt – We would love to see you in some respectable and well written roles please!Omi Vaidya – Avoid repeating the Chatur accent in every film as it will be great to see some new variation coming from you.Direction wise, it evidently looks like a first attempt, but I would still like to congratulate Rohit for his hard work and efforts. However there is lot to learn and achieve for the young entrant and luckily he has got one of the best teachers in his own house as his father, David Dhawan.In all, Who proves to be the Real DESI BOY here in the film? Its undoubtedly, PRITAM, the music director who at least gives us something to enjoy in this otherwise sheer waste of time. And the Soundtrack surely can be rated much better than the whole film itself.So, is it watchable? Yes, you can watch DESI BOYZ, in case there is a delay in your train or flight and the bookstore at the station has left with only Biscuits to sell in the shop." 
" make some noise for the Desi boyz!!!","Excellent.... Excellent movie.... 2011's best. Akshay Kumar is undoubtedly the baap of bollywood. This movie is far far far better than the hits like Ra.One , Ready , Singham ,Bodygaurd n more. Easily the best of the year.now the story :- Desi Boyz (A) is the story of two friends, Jerry alias Jignesh Patel (Akshay Kumar) and Nick Mathur (John Abraham), who live in London and who are hit hard by recession. Jerry does odd jobs for a living as he is an undergraduate but Nick has a white-collar job. However, both find themselves jobless due to the economic downturn. Jerry has a little, school-going nephew (Master Virej Desai) to look after as the child has lost both his parents. Nick is to marry his girlfriend, Radhika Awasthi (Deepika Padukone), who dreams of a lovely wedding, a great honeymoon and a wonderful house to live in after marriage.Out of job, Jerry finds it difficult to even pay the school fees of his nephew because of which the government is on the verge of giving the custody of his nephew to a foster family. Nick fears, he won't be able to fulfill the dreams of his to-be wife. It is to tide over the difficult times that Jerry and Nick turn to the oldest profession in the world. They become male escorts, fulfilling the costume fantasies of girls and ladies. Ironically, Jerry can't ultimately prevent his nephew from being sent to a foster home; and Nick loses Radhika when she learns of what he has been up to while she is away in India. Frustrated, Nick blames Jerry for forcing him into the profession and asks him to move out of his house and life.Nick now tries hard to win Radhika back and help comes from the most unlikely source – Radhika's father (Anupam Kher) who has come to London with her. Meanwhile, Jerry registers in college again to complete his graduation so that he can earn enough money to get his nephew back home. In college, Jerry meets Tanya Sharma (Chitrangada Singh) who used to be his over-sized classmate and is now a hot and a sexy professor in the same college. Sparks fly between Jerry and Tanya.What happens thereafter? Is Jerry able to pass his examinations and get a degree? Does he get a job? Does Radhika forgive Nick? Or does she settle down with Ajay (Omi Vaidya), a lawyer-friend of hers? And what about Jerry's nephew – does he unite with Jerry? story - 8/10 Direction - 9/10 Acting - 10/10 (Akshay kumar and Sanjay Dutt steal the show) Movie Review - 9/10." 
" Looks like Akshay is finally came to his senses..!!","Akshay Kumar(Akki)'s comic timing and Daddy David Dhavan's experience  in Comedy movies works together to bring a decent entertainer. Of  course there are dull moments especially emotional ones and some  senseless situations, story-line is decent and weak in some parts, but  the funny parts hide most of these to make this a good entertainer..!!  Debutant director Rohit Dhawan son of David Dhavan's this  Comedy-Emotional-Romance with of course Indian Masala Story which is  definitely tolerable and nice Time-pass. Akki's talent was hidden in  few intolerable movies from 2-3 years, but this time he succeeds to lit  fire on screen and he comes back. Rohit Dhavan's mind, Akki's talent,  Akki-john chemistry, Two hot 'tottaas' and witty dialogues by Renuka  Kanzru are highlight of the movie, Still, Magic of Akki worked above  all, after a longtime.  Movie will start with an introduction to recession when childhood  friends Jignesh "Jerry" Patel (Akshay Kumar) and Nikhil "Nick" Mathur  (John) will be living together and enjoying life. Nick is an Investment  banker and Jerry works as security guy in a mall. Nick is in love with  Radhika Awasthi (Deepika Padukone) and they decide to marry and she  will be planning for her exotic marriage and expensive honeymoon, and  now recession hits London and boys lose their jobs. After losing jobs  we get to know that Jerry had sister who died with her husband in a  accident (AS USUAL..!!) leaving a boy to look after, Veer (Shraman  Jain)..!!  Now all responsibilities makes boys to work as Male escorts in most  popular strip-club in town, "Desi Boyz"..!! Where they get successful  as hottest Strip Boys as 'Rocco & Hunter' in London, but when Radhika  finds out, she calls off the marriage as well as love also this job  makes Jerry to lose Veer (Nephew)'s Custody. Boys quit the job and  since Jerry is the reason for Nick to join in "Desi Boyz", it brings a  fight which departs boys .  Now without any money, bankrupt boys will get serious about career and  relationship. Nick will fighting for love outside Radhika's house by  pleading forgiveness and her father Suresh Awasthi (Anupam Kher) will  be helping Nick in this, where Jerry will rejoin College to complete  his graduation and get a reputed job so that he regains the custody of  Veer. In college he meet his old classmate Chitrangada who is economic  teacher for him..!!  Will boys succeed in what they started now..?? Will boys get together  as before..??  Movie is fun and maintained with required emotions and sentiments since  its an Indian movie, here it succeeds and it really brought a good and  very simple story-line as a good time-pass. Screenplay-direction-Story  by Rohit Dhavan tells us there is a bright future for David Dhavan's  son. Akki is back on track with right choice of role, John as usual, no  expression-only body-abs exposure (Which is really great though..!!),  but there was a good chemistry between John and Akki. Deepika and  Chitrangada were filled with performance and hotness and succeeds to  impress. Anupam Kher and Omi Vaidya were excellent, and Sanjay Dutt's  cameo was a treat. Music by Pritham was just okay with few foot tapping  numbers. Cinematography by Natarajan Subramaniam covering exotic places  in London is a treat to eyes.  Movie is of course "A" rated with 2 Hot Strip boys and many adult jokes  like 'Qualifications chodo, apni measurements toh bolo", while Akki  filling out the application form for "Desi Boyz" he writes his shoe  size in the column size and many more. Anupam Kher and John getting  high with Grass and telling themselves to 'Keep off the grass' includes  in the list.  Its just one time watchable, but still Watch it for Akki and for fun  with your bunch of friends, and you have to expect a dramatic climax  scene which i really do hate but this was funny but of course senseless  and i wish it wasn't there. Girls will love to see 'Rocco' and 'Hunter'  shirtless and Nick in Yamaha Vmax, and boys will be seeing only Deepika  and Chitrangada when they are on screen." 
" A lively movie with fairly good structure","Desi Boyz is set in the time when the world had gone into recession (2007-8). It was a well chosen setting seeing as it sets the tone for the whole movie. Most of it is revolved around the two main characters struggling financially and having to resort to being male escorts. The storyline is pretty clear and simple, and the music is very, very good. It appeals to all audiences due to the fact that the film is set in England, and shows some of the English landmarks. All in all, the movie is well structured, however there are a few niggles that I have, such as the problem that many of the English people have voice overs which make them sound American. For me, the voice overs do spoil the movie somewhat, as they're either too stereotypically British or they make British people sound American." 
" Akshay Comback after a lot of flops","Akshay Kumar after Singh Is King in 2008 gave only flops until Housefull 2010 and De Dana Dan 2010 and his flop streak continued until now where we come to Desi Boyz his comeback. The movie has a plot based on a true story which happened in UK, based on the recession problem. Akshay and John are leading good lives until the ression starts to bite and they become jobless. They become strippers to earn money and when John's girlfriend finds out, she dumps him. The movie carries on and ends with a happy one. The movie is filled with comedy which is well executed, Akshay Kumar and Sanjay Dutt steal the show, even Omi Vaidya the guy from three idiots did well. The end courtroom drama was a bit silly yet still entertaining. The music is really good, Make Some Noise for the Desi Boyz, Subha Hone Na De, and Jhak Mar Ke are really awesome. Acting is good, Akshay doesn't do loud comedy like he did in duds like Tees Maar Khan. Overall, a masala movie which good and entertaining, this movie will definitely be a box office hit." 
" A Nutshell Review: Desi Boyz","I would like to pride myself at watching enough Bollywood films to have witnessed the pairing up of most of its stars, but this marks the first I've seen with Akshay Kumar and John Abraham put together as two best buddies whose foreigner status in a foreign land meant the execution of some protectionist strategies when companies are forced to take a cold hard look at their expenses given the downturn of the economy. They get the boot in their respective jobs, with Jerry Patel (Kumar) probably suffering the least impact since he's leaching off his best friend Nick Mathur (Abraham), an investment banker who had seen better days himself.So when all the doors get slammed in your face, either being too qualified, or under qualified for a job, the duo get thrown a lifeline through the enigmatic head (Sanjay Dutt) of a worldwide franchise of male escort agency called Desi Boyz, who is of the impression that these two men at wits end would be a welcome addition to his stable, since they have chest, biceps and size (if you know what that means). Similar to the Full Monty, but expectedly not as naughty by international standards, their job is to spread happiness amongst the female clientèle, with good money at stake if only they would bury their conscience, and be professional about it.Most of the song and dance routines worked when it called for the duo to be paired up, with both Akshay and John sharing incredible chemistry as their new alter egos Rocco and Hunter, strutting and flaunting their assets, providing everyone a good time, the audience included, with director Rohit Dhawan knowing just the right camera angles to capture the duo at their hunky best. Akshay Kumar plays his role with that mischievous glint in the eye, having to persuade his best friend Nick to join him in just making a living, and the house is brought down during their joint-introduction as the newest, hottest male escorts in town.In what would be keeping up of appearances, being fearful of their reputations and worrying that ivy league degrees would be going down the drain in his new profession, which is something that would echo loudly in anyone here who is thinking of such a niche provision of pleasure, the first half introduces very fleetingly what would be taking on the bulk of the screen time after the interval. Nick had just proposed to materialistic girlfriend Radhika (Deepika Padukone) who wants the world for her wedding and honeymoon, and is kept in the dark of her boyfriend's financial predicament, while Jerry has to battle the state in order to be the legal guardian of his young nephew Veer (Shraman Jain), failing which Veer would have to go to a foster home.What worked wonders in the first half are the joint efforts of both stars when they grace the screen and feed off each other's infectious energy, with the narrative moving at a very snappy pace. The bulk of the kinkiness seen in the trailer all belong to the first half of the film, making you contemplate just exactly how much more could the envelope be pushed. Sadly it isn't much, but everything that suggests raunchiness in the film, were confined to the portion before the interval, after which it became a lot more serious with the duo off their separate ways to pursue their respective objectives and goals in life.Rohit Dhawan, Renuka Kunzru and Milap Zaveri who wrote the screenplay and dialogues knew just what would work, and these got delivered by a very able supporting cast, from Dutt and ranging to a surprise guest whom I will keep under wraps lest it would mar anyone else's viewing experience. But their second half somewhat contradicted the team play at work here, and having the leads focused on their own narrative tracks, turned the film completely over its head. Out the window was everything associated with fun from their male escorting exploits, and what got introduced were very plain narratives such as Nick's fervent pursuit of his lady love Radhika who cannot come to terms with so many paying females leering at her fiancé, and Jerry off to school to complete his degree, get a well paying job to boost his adoption chances of Veer, and romancing his ex-classmate turned lecturer Tanya (Chitrangda Singh).First time director Rohit Dhawan employed the breaking of the fourth wall by the lead characters very liberally, allowing them to engage with audiences directly, then curiously this become nothing more than a footnote in the film as the later stages junked this for a more conventional approach. While Deepika and Akshay had been paired together for a couple of films already such as Chandni Chowk to China and Housefull, this film marks her first romantic pairing with John Abraham, and while they look good together on screen, Radhika the character was perhaps the weakest in Deepika's filmography to date. Akshay Kumar got the second half of the film to thank for in including a romantic lead for his character, and throughout you can't help but to feel the competitive vibes between both Akshay and John, and perhaps rightly so whenever you put two hunky guys together in the same film.As a comedy, Desi Boyz worked in the first half when the stars hammed it up as male escorts, but unfortunately this did not manage to pan out for the entire film when it was decided a change in direction was required. Still, amongst the comedies seen of late from Bollywood, Desi Boyz has that little bit of oomph to tickle one's funny bone especially with its bevy of stars not taking everything too seriously." 
" Desi Boyz sucked big time!!!","In Desi Boyz, there is a scene where Akshay Kumar extols the discovery of Zero by Aryabhatta. Zero is also the number of times i laughed while watching Desi Boyz, and that statistic for an intended comedy drama, is damning to say the least. Speaking of which, it is a curious movie indeed- because there is neither comedy, nor drama, just a 2 hour trip into nothingness.Its London and the 2008 recession, and Nick (John Abraham) and Jerry (Akshay Kumar) take the full brunt of it- jobless and penniless, yet for both with their baggage's in the form of an expensive girlfriend and dependent nephew, the only possible recourse, is to enlist in Desi Boyz, a global male escort service- defined dumbly in the movie as the only "recession proof" job. And in a firm that asks you your "size" during sign-up, all our heroes are asked to do is to spread happiness, which according to the director mainly involves dancing with skimpily clad "needy" women. Hell, if it were only that and i could shake a leg, male escort services, here i come!With a film directed by "king of crude comedy" David Dhawan's son, boasting of comedic talents such as Akshay, Anupam Kher, Satish Kaushik, Sanjay Dutt, and yet they are not able to tickle your funny bone- is a shame. To his credit, Rohit Dhawan creates potentially funny situations, but muddled direction ensures they all fall flat. And by muddled, i mean every scene is treated in a comedy-drama way, not comedy or drama! The final courtroom drama is such a farce, left me cringing. The music makes you feel Pritam just rehashed some of his older numbers.Its also a shame that the moments close to being funny in the movie come from Omi Vaidya and he too just does an extension of his "Silencer" act. While Akshay is his usual energetic self, and John has his perennially dumb expression (btw he is an finance whiz kid to boot) on earnestly throughout the movie, the leading women are disastrous. While Deepika Padukone should stick to ramps permanently, Chitrangada Singh is an interesting case study- in the middle of the movie she explains cross elasticity, when one product affects demand characteristics of another product, maybe she was speaking of herself. Is Jyoti Randhawa's golf going through such a lean patch that she has to put herself through THIS? A very talented actress, yet looked so out of place in a crass comedy with oodles of makeup, insufficient clothes, and high heels.Here's the most useful piece of information in this write-up by a wannabe male escort....Be afraid, folks, be very afraid- a sequel to Desi Boyz is already in the works. I am already running, are you?" 
" Waste of time","Don't bother to go to theaters to see this nor even rent a DVD. It is pretty awful to sit thru 2 hours and definitely would not recommend it. What a waste of acting talent on this movie. I expected more from this movie since it is packed with talent but the whole storyline, editing, is awful; actually the movie does not flow smoothly at all .I did not expect any storyline as figured this would be a slapstick comedy. Unfortunately I could count on my hand how many times I laughed. Also about time Indian movies start rating the movies because this is definitely not a family movie! More like a "girls night out type movie". Definitely not a guy type movie Please do not take kids to watch this "farce""
