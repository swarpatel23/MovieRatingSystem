" With A Topic So Relevant, This Movie Is Great Satire!","Mainstream Bollywood movies suck for sure. But this low budget comedy- drama taking on the ever-increasing prices of daily commodities in India, specifically Haryana is a must-watch.Sanjai Mishra as the lead is amazing with him being a breadwinner of a middle-class family. His wife runs a salon while his brother is in love with a grocery-shop owner's daughter. The plot moves up as the family takes a loan under the disguise of opening a grocery store. Things fall apart when the loan inspector arrives. Now, what they do of the money & how they tackle the mounting consequences is a wonderful comic show & I enjoyed it.The message that shoots up is essential & with all its glory of cinema- watching, I rate it 7/10.BOTTOM LINE: Go for it, because it has good cast, good humor, good story & a wonderful message - food for thought!Can be watched with a typical Indian family? YESLanguage: No <> Alcohol: No <> Smoking: Mild <> Sex, Nudity or Mouth-Kiss: No <> Violence: Very Mild <> Gore: No" 
" An obscure gem","This movie is so small, most people don't know it exists. Yet, it deserves to be seen by more people because of its sheer brilliant satire and comedic flair.Sanjay Mishra shines as the main protagonist with a great supporting cast. Anyone living in the Indian sub continent will easily identify with this film. The director has caught the essence of middle class citizens masterfully. The humor is subtle, not over the top which is rare in Indian cinemas. You will connect with the characters instantly. Overall, I rate it 8/10. Go watch this one and you will have some food for thought, while having a good time." 
" A surprisingly enjoyable film","One of the other reviewers, Mohammed, refers to this film as being a 'Hidden Gem', which is a beautiful way to describe it.It is a well-acted, well-scripted, well thought out film that provides the watcher with everything from pathos to poignancy. All the major parts are played perfectly; the two brothers, the wife, the father, the loan inspector, the shop keeper, the prospective parents in law, the various friends - there isn't a weak link amongst them, which is unusual with such a large number of characters all with speaking roles.I think the director, Anshul Sharma, should be very proud of what he's created here, as tackling a social issue such as inflation and how and impacts on the lives of the typical family, isn't always easy to do, and is particularly hard to do in an entertain and watchable way - and that is exactly what this film is.So if you've had your fill of all-action Masala movies and fancy something a little more thought-provoking well do give this little gem a try." 
" Cost of Living Comedy","This movie is set in small town India and is all about the strange things people do to overcome the cost of living. It touches upon some rather serious issues, such as, hoarding, black marketeering, love marriages, among others but the touch is light as this is a comedy drama.This is not Bollywood but it is not Bengali Art House Cinema either. The narrative is straightforward and the acting is believable. This is the first review I have written on this site and I did so because I did not want anyone to miss out on a film that should be more widely known. This is a comedy drama of some merit." 
" Inflation made light","The film was a pleasant break from the usual movie plots.The film revolves around inflation and all its consequences that hit an ordinary family without letting such a serious topic weigh on the viewer. There was enough humour to make it an enjoyable film.The only downfall that really ruined the film for me was the part of Gopal, which seemed out of place in such a film. I can understand that perhaps a film based only on inflation could be heavy going and that adding a love story would help it flow more easily. However, the actor himself had no screen presence and his character was only that of a spineless, useless man, too selfish to realize the struggles his family is facing.Despite all this, I highly recommend giving Saare jahaan se mehnga a watch as it presents a change from many films out there!" 
" Must watch","One of the best movie. A simple with full of comedy punch and shows the reality which a low class middle family faces because of inflation. All actors are great . Sanjay sharma far ahead than salma khan in terms of acting."
