" Interesting Just Like Heaven ripoff...","I saw this film expecting it to be absolute rubbish, but i was very pleasantly surprised! All the actors give wonderful performances, and the newcomer Vipasha makes an interesting debut.The story is a complete copy of Just Like Heaven. However, Arjun Rampal made sure that it was slightly different. But just slightly. * Story * Raj Jaiswal, the anchor of a British-Indian show called "British Raj", with a playboy attitude. Raj has the looks, the personality, the style, the money, and the ego to flirt with about 10 girls at the same time. And he normally succeeds, women come and go, and fall by his charms. Enter the pretty Shivani Dutt, who one day walks into his apartment. Raj tells her to leave, but Shivani refuses until Raj hears her out. Shivani is a ghost, a spirit, looking for someone who can support her so she can enter her body, but will Raj believe her? Is this a cruel joke? Why is Shivani doing this?* Review * Pretty good acting.. Arjun Rampal proves he has some skills under those supermodel looks! He manages to pull off his character well, as well as adding a few humorous moments. He looks extremely handsome, and I am sure many more women like me can say that for sure! A good, but average performance.The newcomer Vipasha shocked me. She looks quite pretty, and although she has her bad moments, she performs very well. As well as good facial expressions, she has the correct body language, and refreshes the film. She doesn't have too much to do though, its kind of one of those "stand there and look pretty" films. She does a good job though, but I doubt she will go very far. Chunkey Pandey, as always gives a wonderful, lighthearted look to the movie. He is very good in some parts and is a pleasure to watch. Boman Irani, Sonali Kulkarni, Sophie Chaudhary, and Kirron Kher, give short but gritty performances.And yes, Hrithik Roshan and Shah Rukh Khan make a cameo each! The music is excellent, and full of fun, especially "Subah Subah", and "Halo Halo".Overall, I See You is a light comedy/romance, but through the 2nd half, you see traces of a thriller creeping in.Not a bad movie, but not the best either. I See You, gives a meaning to the word "Average"." 
" Good Potential Gone wrong!","I rented the DVD of this movie, because from the story I had guessed that this film is inspired from the Hollywood movie "Just Like Heaven", and I liked that movie. So I wanted to see how this movie turns out! What I got was a combination of average acting with Plot holes!! The movie gives up the main suspense of the story in the very beginning! The story's potential has not been used to the most! But still, this movie turned out to be a nice "Time pass" flick. Arjun Rampal as RAJ was average and so was Chunky Pandey. But the face to see is that of the new arriving actress Vipasha. She reminds me of Salma Hayek! although she needs to work a lot on her acting, she did a good job in the film. Lots of Special Appearances like Shahrukh,Hrithik,Sonali were an added eye candy! Music was not worth mentioning. But the locations of London were too beautiful! One last word! You can see this movie, but don't expect too much! And if you want to test the strength of the plot then watch "Just like Heaven" Instead!" 
" Not that great",""I See You" is a remake of the Reese Witherspoon/Mark Ruffalo film "Just Like Heaven". While the film does have its flaws, it is not by any means the worst film to come out of Bollywood that has been 'inspired' by a Hollywood film. Arjun Rampal stars as Raj Jaiswal, the host of the successful NRI show British Raj. He moves into a new apartment but soon finds that it is being haunted by a ghost, Shivani Dutt (Vipasha Agarwal) that only he can see, the catch is, she's not a ghost but a doctor who is in a coma after an accident. His friends ponder his senility, but his close friend Akshay (Chunky Pandey) supports him as much as he can. Shivani informs him of a plot that involves doctors stealing and harvesting organs of healthy patients at her hospital.The story has it's flaws, for one, the added story line of the harvesting of organs isn't really needed and doesn't contribute to the story being a romantic comedy. It actually does nothing for the story overall. If they had stuck with the original story, the film would have worked more. At certain points, it is unclear which story line is the central plot.The location and setting is a tired one. The film is set in London but it could have been pulled off in Mumbai or any other Indian city. There is little charm in the way London has been used and the location never fully comes alive.The acting is far from perfect and very flawed. Arjun Rampal manages to carry the film but because the film is heavily flawed and unnecessary, his character tends to replicate that fact. He has persona and charisma, but not enough to make this film work or enough to make it a pleasurable experience. Vipasha Agarwal sleepwalks through her performance and isn't worth a second glance. It is because of her that the film suffers, there is little chemistry between her and Rampal even though he tries his hardest to make it work. The supporting co-stars don't do much but the stand outs are Chunky Pandey as Akshay who is Raj Jaiswal's best friend and Michael Maloney who plays Inspector John Smith, the English Hindi speaking detective investigating Shivani's accident.The writing is un-inspired and the direction is useless. This film joins the ranks of other cheap knock offs that help hold back Indian (or rather Bollywood) cinema rather than allow it to flourish. The high point for some will be the ten second cameo's by Shahrukh Khan and Hrithik Roshan, but at the end of the day, it is their cameos that are selling the film. Not the story, not the writing, not the director and certainly not the actors.4/10: "Just Like Heaven" is far superior over this tripe, even though it is quite a mediocre film itself." 
" waste of time besides the songs.","I watched this recently in India expecting a lot because it was Arjun Rampal, but who knew he would choose a film this crappy? It had few lines of comedy and hit songs, but besides that the story is dull.It's about a talk show host Raj, played by arjun rampal, who lives in Britain. He's a lady's man and can get any lady in a snap. But then when he sees a mysterious lady on his balcony claiming to be somewhat of a spirit. But she's not dead because her bodies in a coma from a accident. Raj is the only one that can see and hear her. She befriends Raj and seeks his help to uncover the truths of her so called "accident". Through out everyone thinks Raj's crazy because he's talking to himself and dancing with himself.A remake of Just Like Heaven, which can't even entertain you for more than ten minutes. The only thing that entertained me was Chunky Pandey's scenes with over emotional wife and the songs.Gaurenteed FLOP." 
" Fresh but Disappointing !!!!!","If you are going to watch this movie for the sake of watching movie, then give it a go cause 'i see you' disappoints you by the lousy script even the storyline was new and could have been made better.Raj, a TV anchor stumbles down a girl or rather a spirit,Shivani who needs his help to get back to her body which is at the ICU (i see you!!) since none else can see her or hear her.Raj initially is shocked but later accepts the realty of being interacted by a spirit, den he falls for her blah, blah, blah.........etc....Arjun Rampal is average, so is the debut actress Vipasha,the saving grace of the movie are its songs and performances by Chunky Pandey and Boman Irani A typical bollywood pot boiler after the first 30 mins.,manages to get a smile on your face by its few comic moments." 
" I can see this","I see you is an enjoyable film. Arjun stars in this supernatural story,and as a lead actor,it's a remarkable film of his compared to the others. Raj Jaswant,bachelor and a famous TV channel host in London,comes across a lady who says she can be seen.heard and felt only by him.Initially not believing it,Raj soon discovers it to be true.He then goes along with her to find out how she has attained this ghostly state,and how he can help her,only to learn that thongs are more complex than what appears to be, and she soon falls in love with him.The concept,authentic or borrowed(From Mohanlal's "Vismayathumbaththu" maybe) is good.Music is beat tapping,choreography is remarkable.Arjun does a fair job.That's why I've given 8 on 10. The sad thing is this film would've probably done better if it had released in the 90's.Such concept is not what people want now I believe. Anyway,it's a near 2 hour entertainer. And don't look for logic.It's a supernatural kind of film,not practical.Just see and enjoy!" 
" Weaving magic...................without logic !!!","I have watched over 600 movies in my life so far, but few have taken me back to the time when I was a kid; when I would appreciate movies without taking them apart scene by scene as I watched. Well, that is my advice to you; if you decide to watch this movie, take the over-logical critic out of you and ask him/her to stand out of the theater while you watch this movie. And yes, take the kids in your family with you. I see few films made these days which can be watched with kids around and this movie is a welcome exception. I don't know whether this movie will be a "guerenteed" flop; I know I liked it. This movie is a breath of fresh air. Illogical, yes but then again, when has life followed logic ?? P.S. Yes, the songs are good. But I would have liked the movie even without the songs." 
" Feel good cinema!","Happened to watch this movie, 'I see you' recently. I have nothing to do with films by profession but whenever I watch a movie, I end up researching a bit on it too. So researching on 'I see you', I found out it was a commercial failure. I kind of couldn't believe it. It was actually a quite good feel good cinema- a similar feel I had when I watched Abhay Deol's debut, 'Socha na tha', which also didn't do well commercially.
At some level, movies do need to be commercially viable, but sometimes factors other than a 'good movie' might play a role. I admire Arjun Rampal's body of work but that doesn't mean I blindly believe in all his movies. I didn't like 'Dil ka rishta' or 'Humko tumse pyar hain' for that matter. But 'I see you' was a movie that I really came to like.
First of all, the concept of the movie, a spirit showing up in a happy go lucky guy's life from nowhere is of course imaginary genre. But then the movie doesn't try to prove anything about ghosts here. It just shows a weird possibility of such a thing happening to a regular person. And then a little love story developing between the spirit girl and the guy! Then there is a villain doctor who is trying to kill the girl but the guy helps to save her. That way the story is simple. 
But what is unique here is the treatment. It's like easy breeze, just like the song 'subah subah' (it has three special appearances btw! Sharukh, Hrithik and cute little Mahikaa!!!). The scenes and background music are very easy flowing and without too much drama. I guess this is bit too easy-breezy for the typical Bollywood masala audience who are treated with lots of sensational roller coasters in most movies.
What's nice about the movie is the interaction between the spirit and the guy. Once the guy accepts the spirit is a real presence in his life, the flow of energy between them is very natural building up to a romance. The scene where the guy calls the spirit 'khubsoorat', or where he sings along the streets of London with her, or how she transforms his view of life at times is all well done. 
The movie also carries lots of comic moments around the spirit. But again, it's not your slapstick type. It's subtle and nuanced comedy. The guy, Raj, running away from the hospital, his friend Akshay's disbelief, hospital scenes where Raj and Akshay save a life, Boman Irani as the psychologist, Sophie Chowdhary as the damsel co hostess with Raj, all are quite funny scenes. 
Performance wise, Chunkey, Boman, Sonali, Sophie, Kirron- all do a great supporting job in their roles. The girl Vipasha as the spirit is likable, but I felt something was amiss. Perhaps her little girl like dress which she had to wear for the whole movie was a set back to her. She needed something more 'spirit' feeling since the movie is about her being the spirit. Acting wise, she is not bad, but could have been more charismatic with an aura especially again for being a spirit.
But the best part of the movie other than its music is Arjun Rampal. He looks gorgeous in all his movies (well he may look great just out of bed, brushing his teeth also, still..), in this movie, he looks one of his best looks. He is posh, stylish, suave, well spoken (hindi or English, the guy says his lines with such ease and charm, with that amazing baritone).. but the best part is he is endearing. His comic timing is subtle but effective. He emotes just enough never going overboard, nor underplaying. He is so charming as the flirt and then this really nice guy who comes around to help the spirit.
Now coming to the flaws of the movie- I feel the spirit should have been more enchanting than it is. Because the movie is based on the spirit and the romance between her and Raj. The climax should have been more effective perhaps. Because when it all builds up, the movie just ends without cashing on it. The last scene where the girl and the guy meet again could have been more interesting too.
Cinematography and music in the movie are top notch.
With all this, I see you, is still a really nice movie to watch on a gloomy day and feel nice. I think it failed because of not having the masala factors, item songs, sloppy jokes and OTT sequences! Was multiplex a thing when the movie released? I don't know! Yet, I would recommend it to all feel good movie fans and Arjun Rampal fans! Lovely it is!" 
" Romantic Silliness !","***It has spoilers about (Just like Heaven - 2005) too***The Indian cinema makes about 900 movies per year. So when they remake many American movies, I don't blame them. The American cinema itself used to remake a lot of its movies or others' movies, so the thing isn't the idea of the remake as an evident of insolvency inasmuch as the quality of it.Here, it's a remake of an American movie, produced 1 year earlier, entitled (Just Like Heaven) which seemed like optimistic copy of (Ghost - 1990) however. However, the Indian remake has no recognition about the original source of its story. So how they'll deal with the American copyright? It's not my problem. My problem IS the script of this movie!It just told us everything from the start, including the state of the female doctor as alive in a coma, while that was the biggest surprise in the original. Maybe blowing it up like that was to give hope to the audience, to guess the happy ending. Not the best motive though. But let's say that this script will compensate it by another thrilling surprises, good comedy or tender romance. The ugly truth is that there isn't almost anything of the above in here!I thought that they made some changes to create more profound movie. For example, the hero became here a host of entertaining TV show, maybe to make a creative irony between the 2 lead characters. Namely, the girl, a doctor's ghost, as a scientist who will ask the boy to believe in fantasy, and judge by his heart. And the boy, as a show business guy, who's less imaginative and more materialistic; living blinded by the lying flashes of his world. However, I was such a naive. Because the movie disappointed all of that ambitious depths. For instance, there is a scene in which the girl makes the boy walk blinded. It was an attempt from her side to make him see clearly, feel the reality of humans and things, and be more sensitive, or "lighter" just like her; as we all want to be: a pellucid spiritual human. It was wonderful, but unfortunately, just a slight scene in a flood of boredom. So when I ask myself about the reason why the movie's makers didn't bother themselves making some CGI to show the heroine like a transparent ghost, I don't think that that was a trick to make us focus on the events, as a love story with philosophical meanings. NO my dears. It was maybe a trick to cut down the budget!Probably you'll never stand the gullibility of that script. For instance: why the sprite came to that boy in particular?! He didn't rent her flat as the original! When he went to the hospital as a doctor to steal the body, he didn't even disguise while he works as a host of a popular TV show! When she forced him to kidnap her body from the hospital, to save her from the evil doctor, she - as a doctor herself - didn't do a thing to cure herself. Instead, she begged him to leave the body, so they could BOTH go to a party, thus we have the opportunity to watch a big dancing number!! It was weak link between the British officer and the sidekick merely to find out who robbed the ambulance! The heroine made the officer see the body because she loved that TV host, so she wanted no troubles for him?? Actually that what would bring the troubles for him! Though when the officer discovered the truth, he didn't accuse him of anything?! Speaking about that officer's character, it looked initially like inspector (Clouseau), then turned out to be mixed up between being funny or serious! If the heroine knew about the real crimes of that doctor, then why didn't she, as a ghost, unearth some proofs at the hospital, so our very hero and his idiot friend make some thrilling comic mess till they expose the crimes.. or anything instead of that poor climax where the officer catches the criminal so easily! And it's needless to say how dull and slow the way that that felon doctor was trying to kill his colleague with, during her coma!!And when that script tried to make semi-meaty romantic scenes, they ended up as fabricated. Remember when the boy was losing the girl at the end, thinking that she was dying, how she talked sadly about herself being a ghost for all her life before the accident. In fact, that was very important storyline in the original movie, which had absolutely no presence here since the start. So what in God's name she was talking about here??!! And finally, an exclamatory question; what about the matter of making the whole movie in England, where this TV host, his crew, the doctor, the receptionist of hospital are all Indians, with English officer who can speak Indian also?!!The acting was close to horrible. (Arjun Rampal) wasn't a comedian or trying to be one, looking so dull like a male model in a fashion show. (Vipasha Agarwal) definitely delivered better performance, but with a script that gave her nothing to do except smiling all the time!Despite the well-meaning message, and the too many Indian guest stars (like Shahrukh Khan as a guitar player in the street??), this as an Indian movie, was wretched and inferior. And as a remake, it wasn't a romantic comedy as the original, but a romantic silliness. So my advice to its makers is: Please, watch more movies, not to remake them, but to learn how movies are made in the first place!" 
" Not Great but not terrible either--excellent music","Arjun Rampal is endearing and quite human though he has difficulty emoting both while lip-syncing and in scenes with Vipasha, who is has a lovely face but anorexic body. Her acting wasn't bad though not outstanding. Chunkey is annoying and unsympathetic as a character and we didn't find him funny. Michael Maloney steals the show as a Hidi-speaking cop. The actors aren't given much to work with considering the plot in which not much happens and there is no clear goal. Nevertheless, we never felt like not watching the film and it was a decent experience overall.The songs are great, however and we listen to them all the time. "Subah subah" is guaranteed to wake you up and is energetic. "Sach Hui" is dreamy and the celebrated Sunidhi who sings it conveys a powerful sense of longing that shows why she is a great singer. "Halo Halo" is quite danceable and we use it to work out. "Kehna Hai Jo" is a toe-tapper." 
" I have my copy too!","True, 'I See You' is an exact replica of 'Just like Heaven'.The entire plot has been copied without leaving even a single element behind!! This starts right from the fact that Viphasa (Reese in Just Like Heaven) meets with a car accident that puts her into a coma and results in her spirit roaming around in the city. She meets Arjun Rampal in his apartment room, again typically Just Like Heaven and what's more, Viphasa too like Reese is a doctor and falls in love with Arjun!!! Though the story is good, its not original and that is what brings it down! And I bet, Vipasha didn't perform better than Reese! I'd recommend people to watch 'Just Like Heaven' instead! ;)" 
" songs were really good","The movie in itself was similar to A Lot Like Heaven and at first seems rather shallow, but later on as the plot progresses, the movie is a little easier to get into as long as you approach the movie with an open mind and not one of "because Arjun Rampal is in it, it's going to be great", which is what a lot of people think. The songs are really good especially Sach Hui by Sunidhi Chauhan and Halo Halo which is instantly catchy which Sach Hui is a song you can sit back and listen to. The movie is also supported by Kirron Kher which has acted in some really good movies in the past such as Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna and Hum Tum as well as Mangal Pandey: The Rising, all of which are really good movies. This is the debut movie of the main actress and while most might not have an instant attraction to her, by the end of the movie you will almost fall in love with her. The strikes at comedy might have been slightly overdone but provided a sense of variety to the entire movie that made it enjoyable to my family and I. Definitely something worth watching."
