" Ridiculously pretentious, wannabe cool action thriller","This film is one piece of a joke. A complete mishmash of wannabe cool action scenes and heroes (and heroines), all lifted from different famous foreign action movies. Awfully uninspiring, terribly melodramatic and overdone, with a clich√© and unoriginal screenplay. The cast is just one bunch of poseurs. Abhishek Bachchan is in the lead, and he is awfully miscast as the "tough" cop. Sanjay Dutt has nothing to do there. Sunil Shetty unsurprisingly overdoes his role and Zayed Khan is more laughable than funny with his annoying fake accent. Shilpa Shetty's Tomb Raider look is one of many mistakes made in the career of an otherwise talented actress who did not get good role offers. At times I was really wondering what the director was thinking while copying some of the most famous scenes of Hindi films. Like, for one, the group song which had them all singing a song when out of nowhere they noticed Sanjay Dutt's serious expression, stopped singing, and then, he suddenly starts singing and dancing with them in a very cheesy way. It is so clearly lifted from the song "Mehndi Laga Ke Rakhna" from Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jaayenge, involving Amrish Puri and Shahrukh Khan. The final scene is simply pathetic, and so is this film. Avoid this dreadful cheapo at any cost." 
" Surprisingly good","I was pleasantly surprised with this movie. I thought great,another macho,action- Indian flick, but was pleasantly surprised when I actually found myself enjoying it. The film is magnificently produced. The acting is outstanding and the narrative, unbelievably good. You could be fooled into thinking your were watching a Hollywood film, rather then an Indian one at times. The action scenes and special effects were amazingly realistic, proving that a lot of care and attentive details went into making this movie.Abhishek Bachchan has proved his critics wrong and proudly displayed his acting heritage. Not only did he act good but came across very confident in his character, something that his earlier films lacked. Watch this space, the new king it seems has finally arrived. Zayed Khan also exceeded expectations and was enjoyable to watch. Sanjay Dutt was in top form as were the rest of the cast. Pankaj Kapoor was also brilliant and showed off his versatile acting range.Although this film may not win any big awards it was thoroughly great to watch. The soundtrack was also hip and modern. All in all,this film comes highly recommended." 
" What cr*p was that!??!?","This probably has to be the most over-hyped,over-sold, and over-marketed Hindi movie in history. It was pathetic! No plot, No gripping story line and a big mish-mash of cool scenes from various action movies. Notable were the stolen plot lines from the series 24! I mean - drive below 50 and a bomb goes off? how old is that plot?! and then you have a maniac Canadian cop (with a dud-Indian accent) who decides to run a car-chase with his wife beside him.Second, the ATC boss decides to jump off 100 feet off the edge of a building and land on a ledge perfectly while killing 4 terrorists mid-air. I though such effects only happened in 70's action movies where there were no computers to help! We waited in painful agony for the item number 'deedar de' - and when it came it was a disappointment. It had rough editing and flare flashes that could trigger off an epileptic fit in anyone! Cuts were so short that it didn't do any justice to the dancing prowess of the latino item girl! Gulshan Grover as a bin laden look-alike - how sad is that? It seems like the director was probably given the script as he was shooting and decided to improvise as he went along. I mean, did anyone notice the red subaru imprezza with a huge "ford mustang" sticker on it? SAD SAD SAD! and what was with that bad-hair-day cut with abisheks girlfriend (or was she just a cop?) Zayed Khan was just plain annoying - probably the only person that deserved credit was the Indian joe pesci from lethal weapon(see - didn't i tell you!) Buy the Audio CD - good tracks. Don't go anywhere near a theatre playing this flick. Its awful." 
" Totally derivative and quite devoid of any idea in directing","This is the worst Michael-Bay-aping pseudo film I've ever seen. The acting is pathetic, the direction cretinous and the filming of the dance numbers downright criminal. The editor must have thought he was a wizard with all this frantic pasting, but it shows total disrespect for the dancers.The scene where the terrorist is eliminated somewhere in the open Canadian countryside is so unbelievably derivative (those RESERVOIR DOGS shots of guys clad in black advancing in slow-motion toward the camera)and ridiculous (the good guys seem to be impervious to bullets) it has to actually be promoted as a prime example of idiotic direction.And Sanjay Dutt must make a dramatic elephant out of the slightest existential fly. For the most undiscriminating audience only." 
" Pathetic Movie","Just watched this movie. My only advice is- do not bother watching this, it is pathetic. It is just style and no substance. If you want to watch a Hindi movie, there are excellent ones out there, but not this. There should be some logic in the storyline to digest. Look at this, a stadium full of 20000 people are in danger and the only set of people who can rescue them are five Indians, one of them being a Canadian police officer. Why can't they at least involve Canadian Law Enforcement? Just doesn't make sense. Indian Police officers, who are in Canada, illegally investigating something and just killing people as and when they like and just getting away with it. Anti Terror Cell in India are full of 6 feet tall, fair, blue eyed male officers and the lady officers looks like they all just came out of some modeling school!! They wanted to imitate some Hollywood action movies, but I don't think they were successful in that. If you are a person who grew up watching sensible movies, whatever genre it may be, you are not going to like this one. But if you are a person who believes just in style and want some typical Hindi style entertainment with some good songs, go for it." 
" Be very careful...","Please do not expect anything from this film. It starts fairly well, but after a few hours it gets pretty dull. There are only so many times you can watch men in suits with sunglasses walking towards the camera in slow motion looking moody. This was more like a screen test than a film.The plot is a bit random - it steals bits from the Usual Suspects, Speed, Lethal Weapon 3 etc.I must just give a special mention to the "Football" match at the end. The scenes are shot in an American football ground in the daytime. But, the action keeps cutting to highlights of an England friendly soccer match played in the evening and then back to the Canadian fans cheering. Ouch! Very poor.The worst bit was probably the end, where all the character jumped around fighting kung fu style to try and stop two bombs (which when they go off are quite deflating) and .... SOMEONE DIES!!!!Very moving.ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ1 out of 10." 
" Awesome Movie...Must Watch!","Finally a movie which will make BOLLYWOOD stand-out!Amazing performance,rocking music(Kudos to Director Vishal-Shekhar),Stunning Action sequences and a nice storyline....A perfect recipe for an out-and-out Smash-hit. The story is about the Anti-terrorist Cell from India who receives the info that an International Terrorist "Jhaamvaal" is planning a big attack on 10th May(hence "Dus").Sanjay Dutt(Siddhant Dheer) is the chief of the department of the ATC.Abhishek Bachchan(Shashank Dheer)is his lil bro and an expert sniper.Shipa SHetty(Aditi Kumar),ZAYED KHAN(Aditya Singh) and other form the Elite team.Suniel SHetty( Danesh "DAN") is a Canadian cop which helps out Abhishek and Zayed when they go to canada to track down the terrorist.Pankaj Kapur(Mehendi Singh) plays a naives and loyal henchman to JHAAMVAAL.He is then kidnapped by Abhishek and Zayed along with special agent Esha Deol(Neha) and then begins a superb twisting and turning story.But the best part is near the end when the story takes such a drastic turn and an absolutely brilliant secret unfolds which will definitely make the viewers gasp!! Zayed Khans performance is the most notable as he plays a lovable,cool and suave officer.Hes the glue that holds the film together.Abhishek has improved a lot and comic scenes between him and Sanjay Dutt are hilarious.Diya Mirza(Zayed Love interest) and Raima Sen(Suniel's ex-wife) are quite forgettable.Esha Deol is absolutely disappointing and looks woe-be-gone.Shilpa Shetty definitely makes you drool with her looks and hair!She gives a gritty performance as an officer and a silent lover to Sanjay Dutt.Pankaj Kapur is worth million laffs as he provides lite moments in the film.And finally a big Thumbs-up to Director Anubhav Sinha for this stupendous movie!" 
" Another good movie","Its OK i wouldn't say excellent but still good. What it lacks in sanjay dutt and everything else it makes up for with hot Zayed. and maybe abhishek bachan. The songs were amazing and Dus Bahane is my favourite which still rocks. Chaam se is one funny song. I wonder if people notice the first time they watch the song but if you look really closely there's a background dancer in the beginning with blue shirt, blue trousers and blue jacket going very over the top with his dancing. In that song the guy just makes it so funny. And if you watch abhishek his chuni thing round his neck keeps falin but then finally i think he pins it properly on Zayed khan has some funny lines in the film and AB Jr looks a bit sleepy at times. The Irfan killing scene was the best. What a scene. Did you see the way they entered. It was Sunil in van jumping out with a huge gun. Then A Jr in car planting fires in them and swerving into them (what a show off) then finally Zayed Khan coming in on bike. That was a great scene. Especially when gulshan grover tried to get the gun out but he cant coz hes an old man. Jambwal was very stiff in this movie. At the end he needed someone cutting up his food. And then when sanjay dutt was crying on the floor why couldn't he have just shot him there and there. I mean he was going to kill 20,000 people so why couldn't he kill one police man. Then when Sajay shot him he fell very stiffly as he was made of cardboard. Anyways i think Zayed and Abhishek and Dus Bahane made this film what it is!" 
" dus..wat a movie!","I have no idea what all of u people r saying!! Sure, Dus had it's share of flaws, but come on, the acting had 2 be an excellent part! I mean, look at Sanjay Dutt, what a performance!!!!! As Siddhant, he played the loving brother and tough anti-terrorist detective. His acting was one of the best I have ever seen! Another brilliant thing was the songs, especially Dus Bahane... so very stylish and brilliantly executed. Chham Se was a beautiful engagement song for all..I definitely do believe so! For those who don't normally watch thriller/ suspense/ cop movies, Dus is a movie that you will enjoy very much so, and some of the scenes will linger in your mind after the movie has ended..." 
" A New Era of well crafted Bollywood action cinema","I couldn't wait for this film to come out, the weeks prior I was eagerly anticipating its release singing along to the sensational title song released off the soundtrack (Dus Bahaane). The movie stars some of the most sort after hottest talent around in Bollywood at the moment, Abisheck (watch out king Khan) Bachan, Sanjay Dutt, Zayed Kahn & Suneil Shetty. The feminine factor is provided by the Beautiful Shilpa Shetty & Esha Deol.The film begins with a bang, and for an action movie, not the kind you'd expect, as is the trend more & more these days, an item number (the title song) is laid upon us in the opening reel, Zayed Kahn & Abisheck wow us with their good looks and slick suits singing along to "Dus Bahaane". The actual story centre's around the ATC (Anti-Terrorist-Cell), a special forces police force led by Sanjay Dutt. His best officers are Abisheck (also his on-screen younger brother), Zayed & Shilpa. The officers are led to believe from the opening 20 minutes that a major terrorist sort the world over is planning something BIG on the 10th May, exactly 10 days from the start of the film. The clues lead the team to Canada.In Canada we are introduced to Esha Deal, she plays Neha an undercover officer working for the ATC, she welcomes Abisheck & Zayed who've been sent out by Sanjay to hunt down the terrorist "Jhamwhal". Here the movie accelerates into an explosive pace to catch the terrorist, with lots of twists & turns and great music numbers. The action scenes are a real class act for an Indian film and shows the leaps and bounds Bollywood has made in this area over the years.The ending is some what disappointing as well as surprising but not in the good way, but all in all a good masala action flick !" 
" A lot of style but no substance","Dus had a lot of things going for it, good action, big star cast, chart topping music, and great production values. But it had no story and a very bad screenplay that led to its downfall. This is sad because it had a lot of potential to be great. The title song, Dus Bahane, is the best part of the movie, fast paced song by Vishal-Shekar, pictured well on Abhishek and Zayed is arguably one of the best Hindi film songs in history. The plot is too ridiculous, basically the India anti-terrorist group must stop a plot in Canada. Of the actors only four actors are worth watching; Abhishek Bachchan, Shilpa Shetty, Sanjay Dutt and Pankaj Kapur in that order. I don't even think this film is a decent time pass film." 
" Too many stars spoil the movie!!","What applies to the cooks and broth applies to stars and movie too. Dus was a disappointment to say the least. The only saving grace is the soundtrack... especially the title track.The storyline was the same old Bollywood formula. The casting was OK but their acting was terrible! Sanjay Dutt looks bored all through the movie. He is better as a munnabhai or a Raghu Shivalkar. Shilpa Shetty's role is quite forgettable. The grunge clothes and the fake tattoos don't really go well on her. AB Jr and Zayed Khan looked hot. Isha Deol was horrible!! First half of the movie was still bearable... second half was more torturous on the audience than on the villains!!! The best part of the movie was Pankaj Kapur. His acting was brilliant. Too bad that its wasted on a movie like this.I'd advise you to wait for the DVD to come out. Don't buy it. Just rent it... watch the title track (excellent choreography) and then just return it!" 
" Thrilling, enjoyable, a real roller-coaster...!","Dus a fantastic film with unforgettable twists and turns that keep you glued to your seat. Anubhav Sinha has done a remarkable job directing this film. The story is interesting and thrilling at the same time. Siddanth Dheer(Sanjay Dutt) runs an Anti-Terrorist-Cell in India. He has many people working for him, however, he has his favourites, who are also his most loyal and trustworthy employees. The first one is his little brother Shashank Dheer(Abhishek Bachchan)who is a calm,cool worker with no hassles. The second one is Aditya Singh,(Zayed Khan)a suave,lovable officer with a weakness for women, especially Shashank and Siddhanth's younger sister Anu (Diya Mirza). Finally there is Aditi Kumar(Shilpa Shetty) a hard-core gal that has no problem kicking terrorist butt! Siddhanth also has a soft spot for Aditi and they share a sweet, silent relationship. The film starts with Siddhanth receiving information that an international terrorist named Jambwal is on the loose and is planning a huge bomb blast on 10th May.(hence the name 'Dus') Siddhanth sends Aditya and Shashank to Canada to capture Himmat Mehendi,(Pankaj Kapur)an ex-follower of Jambwal who will know the mysterious secret that that the ATC team want to know. Himmat is kidnapped by Shashank and Aditya along with secret agent Neha(Esha Deol). The team also meet Dan,(Suniel Shetty)a Canadian cop with a gripping past. Just when the story is falling into place, Anubhav Sinha shoves in a twist that shakes it all. As the audience are making sense of the first twist, another twist is put in, changing everything.Sanjay Dutt does a fantastic job as the suspicious, yet caring chief. However, he is showing some elderly signs. Abhishek Bachchan has improved a lot, his comic scenes with Sanjay are hilarious! Shilpa Shetty makes you drool with her looks, hair and awesome toned body. Suniel Shetty makes a gritty performance. Esha Deol is disappointing. She fails to make an impact on the audience. Zayed Khan is the most notable and portrays his character completely. Diya Mirza and Raima Sen(Suniel's ex-wife)make short appearances and are forgotten. Pankaj Kapur does a marvellous job.On the whole, 'Dus' is a film that provides action, drama, romance and comedy all in one." 
" Horrible piece of....","Loose ends...weak screenplay and plot development...half hearted attention to details...unnecessary sub-plots and diversions....although must say technical inputs have improved tremendously...Can't they read and discuss scripts before making a movie?..this seems to be happening time and time again in recent times..e.g. Kaal...Bollywood wants to be Hollywood...tries to hold on to classic Bollywood sensibilities with Hollywood glitz and glamour and makes a mess out of it...very disappointed..acting-wise not a bad job by all the four main guys...probably the only other above average department of the movie besides the editing and action sequences....though female characters did not have the space or screen-time." 
" DUS : Worst movie of the year...",".. few Priyadarshan movies are yet to be released in this year, but I bet you won't find any of them funnier than this creation of Anubhav Sinha. We were laughing like anything when we came out of hall after watching "Thriller" DUS.so here is a plot. wait a minute... was there anything like plot? probably there was. Few brave men from ATC(Anti Terrorist Cell, cool isn't it?)decide to save a big jeopardy which they even don't know about except that it was going to happen on 10th May, but these are brave soldiers. Now IMDb tells me that Naa Tum Jaano Naa Hum and Ab Ke Baras were released on 10th May, but probably more dangerous disaster exist in world, so they are searching for it. After some furious action and some "relay bombing" (as Suniel Shetty can't directly throw grenade, he would pass on that to Zayed and eventually Zayed on flying bike would throw that into car and before grenade could explode lo! Zayed is standing beside Jr. AB and Shetty in order to give that high-profile action movie look). Well they have found some clues and caught a man who helps them in searching the villain Jamaal or Jambal or Jamval or something like that... and when finally so called Jamaal is killed Sanjay Dutt tells them that man who pointed them to Jamaal he himself was Jamaal. Shut up you all morons if you said that this is copied from 'Usual Suspects'. Our intelligent ATC chief Dutt Jr. finds out that disaster is going to happen at stadium. Now at the climax, they found out where bomb is and AB Jr. is on plane with disastrous C-4. Only way he could save Canada is that he jumps along with plane and his love Esha Deol, wait but somebody said she was traitor, but she has to die anyway. and then starts eternal dilemma. Whether Abhishek should die and save people or He should leave Canada to God. Everybody forces him to leave the plane, but he is "true soldier" and saves Canada. May his soul rest in peace.I strongly recommend that everyone should see last 15 minutes of this movie (if you manage to survive till that point). No matter what will happen to that bomb, but Zayed tries to convince Abhishek that not only himself but both should take care of Dia Mirza. Sanjay Dutt is into tears and doesn't care to stop Jamaal who is not running away, but waiting for elevator to come. Sunil Shetty is shouting.. "Fenk Do Bam, Mar Jaane Do Logon Ko.. Kud Kaao Shashank..." Director will teach you geography which you've never learned. He'll enlighten you that AIIMS flyover is situated near some sea or something. I bet you didn't know that.Well, there are few saving graces for movie. 'Dus Bahane' and 'Deedar De' are treat to hear. Pankaj Kapoor proves that he is definitely one of the front-line actors and AB Jr. proves himself again after Sarkar. and yes, how can I forget Shilpa Shetty and her stunts (a la Trinity) and one must not forget the guy, whosoever it is,who made the trailer and posters and made people believe that this is movie worth watching, so go and watch in theaters. arre bhaiyo, suno, agar movie dekho to upper/stall mein dekhana aur mazaa aayega..." 
" u gotta be kiddin me!!!","this is one of the worst bollywood movies i have ever seen.not only in the last few years but probably ever. the screenplay was awful.the plot had nothing new at all.everything that we have seen a hundred times. plus the ending is not so exiting either.well i can't help saying that i was more than surprised to see it rated so high.u gotta be kiddin me .start watching Hollywood originals people. the acting ; well u really can't blame the actors , except that they choose to work in this.the director had left them no choice.the characters were so unrealistic that they cudn't do much about it. watch it if u have got bored from counting stars.still think again ; continuing counting might be more fun."
