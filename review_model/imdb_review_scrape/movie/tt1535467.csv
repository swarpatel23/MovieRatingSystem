" Is this Movie worth a Watch ???","I haven't written movie comments for years, but I feel like this movie deserves a review.I am one of those guys who has been cursing Akshay Kumar the last 2 years for making stupid movies, and getting a lot of popularity for cheap scale movies which has done big on the Box Office screen....I never really understood why people are so fund of watching the same comedy movies over and over Until the comedy aspect dies in the movie and it gets painful to watch the movie example: Action Replay, Tees Mar Khan etc.BUT PATIALA HOUSE made me think different regarding Akshay Kumar and his acting....this movie Akki played very well, and showed his acting skills and he deserves to get credit for that. The show stealer in this movie is Rishi Kapoor, he was perfect as Akki's father and made a powerful impact. Rest of the cast was good and acted very matured and it was good to see Dimple Kapadia again...Anushka Sharma is a delight to watch, every entry she makes the crowd smile, and I can see her one day becoming a top actress in Bollywood.so Is this movie worth a One time Watch: YES and Is this movie worth a Two time Watch: YESGo for this movie, its worth every single cent." 
" Great flick !","The movie Patiala House has been much anticipated. Akki shouldn't be disheartened about earlier movies. i still stand by the fact that Chandi chowk was a good movie that went wrong because it was badly edited. Since "waqt"it has been a long time since we saw akki in a serious role. I can't help talking about him because he is my favourite. Fresh pairing of Akshay and Anushka adds a freshness and appeal to the film. Again additions of new actors was a good idea because it encourages people to appreciate new talent. Also a treat for lovers of Rishi Kapoor- Dimple Kapadia fans. People should appreciate this film as a movie on its own and not compare it to other cricket movies. The movie is not concentrating on cricket but on a person's dreams and aspirations. If you love akshay just like me,then you should watch it!" 
" awesome film","It takes us just five minutes to get the hang of this film's narrative structure. It is as nimbly-paced as a fast-bowler playing cricket in a wide-open field trying to avoid all the roar and din of the cheering crowds in the stands.For a film that has a surprisingly large number of characters (after the 23rd Sikh-Briton running up and down the wooden staircase I stopped counting) the noise decibel is surprising low. The voice of a crowded Sikh household in London never overpowers the emotional kernel of this film.The delicate supple bonds that grow among people, who are not just maladjusted in a foreign land but are also spiritual and emotional misfits in their own household, are brought out in vignettes that show the hand of a confident storyteller.Nikhil Advani's admirable episodic structure of "Salaam-e-Ishq" failed because of its inordinate length. This time Advani takes no chances with the length. Economy of expression is paramount to the effectual storytelling in "Patiala House". Not that Advani shies away from taking risks. The self-assured manner in which he aggregates the characters in a house run by a patriarchal Sikh in Britain (Rishi Kapoor, firmly in command) without crowding and asphyxiating the canvas shows Advani's deep empathy with the characters who drift into his range of vision.At heart, "Patiala House" is a father-son story. Akshay has done them before. One immediately recalls Suneel Darshan's "Ek Rishta" where Amitabh Bachchan was the father who drove son Akshay to a state of smothered silences. In "Patiala House" Akshay's silences scream in wounded protest every time papa Rishi Kapoor's iron hand falls on the boy's dreams.In many ways the screenplay (Advani, Anvita Dutt Guptan) is a compendium of clichés -- despotic dad, timid mother (Dimple Kapadia), unfulfilled son, encouraging girlfriend, her precocious surrogate-son (he reminded me of Kajol's boy in My Name Is Khan). Advani converts familiar characters into real believable warm endearing characters whose lives begin to matter us as we watch them in their Southall setting.The historic data about the Sikh community in Britain is kept at a bare and bearable minimum. The narrative never feels the burden of the cross-cultural migratory journey made by the plane-load of characters. And that's the film's USP.Even as the peripheral characters make a fleeting but coherent impact (Rishi Kapoor's pregnant daughter-in-law's anguish at watching her husband being treated like a doormat is as apparent to us as the family's daughter Hard Kaur's tattoo on the arm), we are constantly seeking out the next chapter in the repressed Gattu's wretched-going-on-glorious life.Akshay plays Gattu with a restrain that never shies away from tears. Every time he thinks of his ruined dreams a trickle of a tear comes down from the side of his cheek. It isn't done for effect. Akshay embraces Gattu's shattering dreams and makes them his own.Is this Akshay's finest performance to date? For the sheer mastery over the heart and soul of his character and the dignity he brings to the loser's character, yes, this is Akshay's best.Akshay and Rishi don't look like father and son. And that's the best compliment one can pay to the film's theme. How can they look like a family, when the father has spent all of his son's growing years denying the boy's sense of the self? Oh, Rishi is a bellowing volcano of arrogant prejudices. Brilliantly bravura as always, Rishi almost echoes the tyranny of Prithviraj Kapoor. His sudden reformation at the end is unconvincing. The unhurried grace of the rest of the film gives away to an urgently-claimed culmination. One can't blame Advani for abandoning the pace at the end. He knows the audience wants a hurried send-off.Anushka Sharma remains effervescent in her volubility. But she needs to play a less talkative character.Though scarce, the moments between Akshay and Dimple are very precious. There is a specially evocative sequence at the hospital when the invalidated Rishi Kapoor tells his screen-wife Dimple Kapadia to shut the door on their screen-son Akshay's face.The film has some exceptionally emotional moments bolstered by Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy's resplendent background score. Santosh Thundiyil's cinematography adds precious little to the proceedings. London doesn't seem to come alive beyond the cricket field.The editing (Manan Sagar) could have been less generous. Portions of the narrative lose their energy. Before it sags, the director swoops up his characters' dreams into curvy shapes. The narrative never loses its way in the maze and clutter of the characters and ambitions.Gattu finally finds his groove. The film never loses it." 
" good movie","What's it about: This isn't the first film to be shot in the Sikh milieu of Southall, a London suburb. However, it would be the first one to have a dozen-odd characters to fill up a palatial Patiala House. Bauji (Rishi) spews venom against the goras after suffering insults at their hands and losing one of his family members in a racial scuffle. A decade on, he still can't let go of the past and issues a no-firangs-allowed diktat. His beta, Gattu (Akshay) is an aspiring fast bowler, whose dreams of playing for his country are crushed in his teenage years. Now a mere puppet in his dad's hands, he's the butt of everyone's jokes, until an army of relatives and another half-blood Punjabi lass (Anushka) inspires him to join the country's team. What's hot: Akshay takes a break from his dime-a-dozen comedies to work in a serious role. What works for him is the fact that he looks like a real cricketer. Even the mock drills when he's rehearsing, look authentic. Given his athletic frame, he looks the part of a fast bowler. He puts in one of his most restrained performances. Rishi Kapoor is pitch perfect in the role of the dictatorial patriarch. His scenes with the Khiladi stand out, delivering the required amount of drama. Anushka has played the chatterbox girl next door before, but she still comes across fresh and likable. Even though the climax is predictable, Advani succeeds in roping you in using the patriotism card. What's not: The biggest grouse you have is this: if Bauji really was that troubled by the goras and their hatred toward his family, why didn't he simply pack his bags and leave? After living in Southall and running a series of businesses there, he still harbors bitter feelings for the locals. Even though it's the central theme of the film, it's a bit difficult to swallow. Also, Advani takes a little too long to get the ball rolling. We understand Gattu's plight, but constant flashbacks and reminders of why he's sad, is a drag on the pace. The songs are weak. Plus, the standout track 'Laung Da Lashkara' comes during the end credits. Even the background score lacks the quintessential Panju punch. With Akshay playing for England and not India, it doesn't really evoke the sense of jingoism that a Lagaan or Chak De! manged to. While the father-son relation is genuinely moving, Gattu's entry in the English cricket team and the climax matches are super cliché ©d and extra filmy. What's that! Poor Dimple gets just one dialogue. Each time she rushes to say something; Rishi stops her with a raised index finger. So much for women empowerment! What to do: Akshay's fans will enjoy his new form. This one may not score a six, but it manages to dispatch one to the boundary." 
" I feel this is a good emotional film.","The script isn't flawless but it definitely has moments that will make you flow in the movie.The cast have done a great job.Rihsi Kapoor was Fantastic in his Mountain Solid role. Akshay does a fantastic work and Sharma plays a great role as a lover. The supporting star cast have also done a great job and if you go with family you'll definitely enjoy the film. It also has a few good comic punches , great song , nice drama and overall definitely a great movie to watch. Who knows you may start believing in Second Chances after you watch this movie.So , go ahead with friends and family and watch this awesome film. Positive points: 1.Great job by the entire cast. 2.Decent Script. 3.Heart Soothing Music and songs. 4.Very good family Drama." 
" One of Akshay Kumar's best films since 'Dosti: friends forever' (2005).","First of all, I'd like to praise the entire production team, but especially the director, Nikhil Advani, for doing such a great job with this. It doesn't actually feel like a film because the characters are so believable and their livelihoods are very normal. The film's story is relatively simple, but it conveys a very important and nice message. Hats off to Akshay Kumar, Rishi Kapoor and Anushka Sharma - they all have given really good performances here. Dimple Kapadia and the supporting cast also do their parts really well. The music is also good. The best tracks are 'Adat hai woh' and 'Laungda Lashkara'. The screenplay is fabulous and the editing has been done very well.Verdict: this film deserves to be a success at the box office - go for it!. I give it 8.5/10." 
" Tradition Vs Dreams","Patiala House:A perfect dish with all ingredients in the right measure..Anushka's bubbly character, Punjabi background, our original bobby couple Rishi and Dimple, the omnipresent Indian Shaadi and cricket.The film essentially debates the eternal Indian subject whether to put our dreams/wishes on the back burner for what tradition/parents demand or go against them to find success and happiness in pursuing our dreams. This movie really surprised me because i expected a gloomy tale looking at the trailers but Akshay's glum character is suitably balanced by the rebellious streak in all other well cast members , anushka's charm, her kid brother, and the wonderful track of Hard Kaur the singer which was a surprise once again and above all with fun songs well and differently picturised with no romantic songs/dream sequences in the swizz alps.highlight of the movie is when akshay manages to get the final wicket and i had a smile and moist eyes at the same time. Well done Akshay, a first for your acting capabilities.Kudos to lyricist.."Mujhe Yunhi karke Khabon Se Juda, Jaane Kahan Chupke Baitha Hai Khuda, Janoon na main kab hua Khudse Gumshuda" ..great stuff!!!Go, watch and have FUN this weekend." 
" Worth a watch!!","I've put off watching this movie for over three months now simply because I have been very disappointed by the last few films of Akshay Kumar. But this movie was a pleasant surprise. The story line is very predictable but the movie doesn't really disappoint in terms of story, acting or plots. The execution of the plot is excellent. Akshay Kumar looks great and so does Anushka Sharma, although her performance is forgettable and so is Dimpla Kapadia. Waste of her acting prowess - she only has one dialog in the movie. Rishi Kapoor looks great as a Sardar and I was hoping Akshay Kumar would don his sardar "avatar" too but he still looks great. I wasn't bored at any point in the movie and I would say the movie is definitely worth a watch" 
" A good inspirational","Howzatt? Punjabi... Balle Balle... Super Hit Dance and Its Super Hit Sixer!!! Bat and Balle's ... Chachaji, Mausiji, Beeji and the entire Yash Raj/Rajshree Family Members assemble from Punjab in United States for this Hindi Punjabi film PATIALA HOUSE. Gattu loves cricket, papa hates it. Rich traditional values and Mom's the word. Papa Don't Preach as Beta respects Pa. As the life goes on, its about Second Chance. Its Punjabi Kudi (the new fresh wave - Baja Baarat Ladki) who encourages and supports Akki to play Cricket and win the game and the heart of the stone hearted Rishi too! All ends well with Winning the Trophy at the stadium and the trophy from the Big Fat Punjabi Family. A Family Get- together at the end for a Big Size Family Photograph. Wonder, what is Bobby doing here. Well She is the Darling of Rishi. Hence she is Bobby Darling and playing Ma in law in real life, she is Ma in reel life. Lucky Mascot, Anushka might have given some fresh waves to Akki - that actually this film is worth a watch than the recent Akki starrers. And speaking about it, Nikhil Advani gets a Thumbs up after his Thumbs down for Salaam E Ishq, CC to China. In one word, the film has hit the Bulls eye and (after Yamla Pagla Deewana) looks like more Punjabi Subjects are a Welcome to Bollywood in Hollywood (as the film is set in UK)... an NRI film!Its More of emotions than comedy in this film that will definitely bring down tears and finally applauds at the stadium scene. With sixers over balls and final overs, the film can be declared a Sure Fire Hit. Finally, Akki can tell that its a HOUSEFULL for his HOUSE (this time PATIALA) and not a nonsense Sajid Khan flick!" 
" A good entertainer with a nice message","Hi Folks! Hope all you readers are doing well and I also hope that this review would be helpful to you.The most important thing that drew me to the Silver Screen to watch Patiala House was Rishiji, Dimple, Anushka and the song Lashkara. With 13 disappointments in a row from Akshay Kumar, I almost had dropped my plan to watch the movie for him but the above reason surely worked in my favor.Patiala House is a story of a Sikh family – UK Citizens, living in Mini Punjab - Southall. The Sikhs have a leader named Bauji (Mr. Rishi Kapoor) who is a local dictator. He has a son Gattu (Akshay Kumar) living a miserable life, deprived of his rights to play cricket for England Cricket Team. The movie further leads to his fight to prove to his father that things have changed and the Indian Origin UK Citizens enjoy same rights as UK Origin Citizens.This movie starts with Gattu narrating his thoughts and the way he leads life. The first half does develop your excitement on how the movie and its characters revolve around each other. Nikhil Advani has done a decent job in the first half where Gattu's character grows and so does Simran's.You will definitely have smile on your face almost in the entire first half. Certain serious scenes too have been treated very well, especially when a family member calls Gattu his father's loyal dog. On reaching the 2nd half, you do get excited on how the movie would grow further. Here too, Nikhil has done a good job in narrating and creating the excitement where Gattu finally decides to go against Bauji and play for England Cricket Team. But the entire credit goes to all the actors involved in the movie (including Akshay Kumar who has acted well surprisingly) to make this script lively.The movies looses its charm post the 1st 20 minutes in the 2nd half when the selection criteria starts and when Gattu is showed playing cricket and blowing against Andrew Symonds from Australia. The entire situation that is created by the director is extremely mellow dramatic and could have been much much better. You tend to get bored till the time the movie reaches its climax where Gattu is showed entering the stadium from the stands instead of pavilion. Nikhil had a very good story and one definitely is happy to see such movies being made but when the vision in unclear, you tend to loose control and I strongly feel that this is what happened with Nikhil. He could have treated the end very well where instead of the typical mellow dramatic approach; he could have given the climax more realistic approach. The match portion is okay but not great as was the hockey match situation that was created in Chak De. Though I don't want to compare any movie with Patiala House, I am forced to since somewhere some portions could have been really treated very well and here the director is the most important person involved.Rishiji, Dimple, Anushka and other actors deserve applaud since they have taken certain scenes to different level of excitement.The music is good and you would definitely enjoy the visuals of all songs. There are 2 songs that I would urge you all to enjoy to the fullest; Biba and Lashkara.I thoroughly enjoyed both these songs.On the whole, Patiala House is worth a watch but post the movie, you have this very though that the 2nd have could have been treated much better than it has been. The movie leaves smile on your face when its over.But I don't want to miss the opportunity to thank Nikhil and the team of Patiala House for making this movie which has a different story, its overall approach and screenplay." 
" There should never be an unfulfilled dream.","This is a movie about dreams that has a strong message throughout the whole movie. It does not disappoint for a second. Everyone has dreams that they want to fulfill, but there are always obstacles nonetheless. Gattu, too faces these obstacles. The story: Gattu is an amazing fast bowler who in his days could get the wicket faster than you can say "wicket". He could not fulfill his career opportunities due to his dad. Ek adhoore sapna re gaya. Watch this movie to see how the story unveils.Casting: Males: Akshay Kumar is the show stealer. He made every scene worth the while. The tears were genuine as if it was his story and that was heart warming. Rishi Kapoor was a delight to see as Akshay's father. He did an outstanding job as the strict "my way or no way" dad. Armaan Kirmani did justice to the role as the brother. In the beginning scenes where his wife tells him not to help Gattu because one servant is enough, the look Akshay and Armaan gave each other was perfect and genuine. The typical reaction to a real life situation. Females: Dimple Kapadia's role as the mother was heart melting. The scenes with Gattu were simply amazing. Gattu/Mom hospital scene was one of the show stealers. Anushka Sharma was simply great with the enthusiastic friend.The others: The rest of the family lost all respect for Gattu for not speaking against their father. I found that a bit annoying. Gattu had only one option, they needed to understand that. When they respected them, it was only after he played again. The family came off as selfish. But that is expected from a strict dad run family. Music: The album is amazing. Laung De Lashkara and Kyun Main Jagoon stand out the most, while the picturing of Rola Pe Gaya was simply brilliant where they go from a modern generation to that of the older generation, showing the major gap and differences. The differences sadly show how things will never be the same, but still a great song. This movie can be watched over and over. It was simply amazing. This can surely be added to Akshay Kumars amazing movies that will never get old. Overall: 10/10" 
" Wholesome Indian Movie as opposed to scum "Three Idiots"","Anouksha Sharma, is fresh breeze amidst these stale fumes of Katrina types who can't act and chew and paan at the same time. These idiots can't even speak Hindi properly I don't even know where these imbeciles came from or imported from. They are put on the top by these banchod scum Khans. When it comes to dancing these Katrina types are disaster. Where as Anoushka, is natural actress specially when she does the fast talking know-it-all girl types. Her screen character's aggressive theatrics go well with a restrained and well mannered Gattu-played by Akshay Kumar. Akshay, can be a good actor, but if only he can stay away from these scum Khans who have gutter taste have no class and their movies are deliberately Anti Indian ("Three Idiots" "Laggan" "Dabaang" "Delhi Belly") with no hint of Indian customs or respect for Indian culture. Even a good actor like Akki, can be guilty by association as in "Tees Mar Khan" which is produced by this lunatic who should be in the asylum directing the inmates. Bar for few, most of these scum banchod midget makaka monkey Khans, are there to take advantage of the unsuspecting Indian audience and pollute,contaminate and brainwash the young audience. The only way Indian Film Industry can retain the illustrious past, is to kick out these suvvar rats from Indian Film Industry. The movie is gripping family drama with Kahlon the Godfather or the Patriarch played by Rishi Kapoor and seemingly well. He is like the old wine that keeps better as he ages. The interaction is so typical of the Indian families if they are in Patiala or Southhall. Prem Chopra even in a short role dazzles. The pairing of Anoushka and Akshay is perfect. With a good direction and music specially the back ground score by Shankar Eshan Loy is reminiscent of score in epic movies. This is a peek and expose into a typical Punjabi family values (not Filthystan values), courage and convictions when we are used to seeing only snippets of it in movies. the cricket should have shown in 3-D as was planned by director Advani. This would have been a great finale to a great enjoyable and wholesome movie that has loads of humor interlaced with heart wrenching emotions." 
" Have the times really changed in England ?","I watched this movie when it was released in February 2011. At that time, I thought the subject matter of the movie was not relevant contemporarily, however suddenly the riots in London have made me feel that perhaps the movie makers must have experienced something like premonition or telepathy that he chose the theme of the movie which was not only true a few decades back but it has again come true after a few months of the movie's release - the hate-filled attacks on the Asians in England, especially London. The movie tells the story of a Sikh family settled in Southall and now the English authorities are praising the spirit of the people (mainly Indians) settled in Southall only in checking this avoidable havoc. Southall is considered a mini India in London and when the astray, unemployed and spoilt English youths are presently on a rampage in London and adjacent towns, the movie appears to be all the more relevant and I feel that by coincidence, it became a movie ahead of its time. The moviemaker has made in the fashion of a masala flick only, intermixing comedy and emotions to the optimum; however, by default, now it has become practically relevant too because the Indians and the other Asians presently being attacked and looted in London must be feeling the same way, the main protagonist of this movie (Rishi Kapoor) feels towards the English.Gurtej Singh Kahlon (Rishi Kapoor) becomes an anti-English when his family is attacked by the English brats and his uncle (Prem Chopra) is killed in the anti-Indian riots. He unites all the Indians living in Southall and go for a lot of development for them through his sheer hard work and dedication. Due to his efforts, not only the Indians prosper there but also his own family becomes a reputed one, settled in a house known as Patiala House. However, his anti-British sentiments cost his talented Cricketer son - Pargat Singh Kahlon (Akshay Kumar) when he is not able to play for England at the international level. Years pass and due to his anti-British fervour, his young family members start feeling suffocated. Since Pargat is completely dedicated to his father and he has willingly sacrificed his ambitions for his father's sentiments, he is the only man in the family who does not have any grudge against the head of the family, i.e., Gurtej or Baauji. However, his heart weeps at his shattered dream of playing international Cricket. Only his mother (Dimple Kapadia) understands and feels his pain. Else everybody in Patiala House only mocks him.I don't know how many people in the real world are lucky enough to get a second chance to fulfil their dreams. However, in at least two contemporary movies, I have seen life providing a second opportunity to the protagonists. Firstly, it's Meghana Mathur (Priyanka Chopra) in Fashion (2008) and secondly, it's Pargat Singh Kahlon who being a fast bowler, gets a chance to play for England at an age when usually the sportspersons seek retirement from playing. How Pargat avails this second opportunity provided to him by the destiny to turn his long-cherished, yet unfulfilled dream into reality and how it leads to an emotional confrontation between the anti-British father and his beloved son, forms the bulk of the narrative which is highly appealing.Patiala House could have become a great movie because it's a movie which contains its heart in the right place. The emotional drama which is the essence of the movie has been presented very well on the screen and it not only moves the audience but also inspires the youths not to lose heart and pursue whatever they are passionate about. However due to commercial constraints, the director could not convert this good movie into a great movie. The post-interval session has been wrapped in comedy in which the family members are busy in preventing Baauji from watching TV (lest he should see his son - Pargat aka Gattu playing on the screen). The songs and dances block the flow of the narrative. Music composed by Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy is admirable because most of the songs are hummable and enjoyable. However there is only one song - Kyun Main Jaagoon which is in sync with the theme of the movie. This sentimental song has been penned by Anvita Dutt Guptan and sung by Shafqat Amanat Ali.Akshay Kumar and Rishi Kapoor have delivered towering performances in the central roles of father-son duo. It's, by all means, one of Akshay's five best performances. Rishi Kapoor is a legend now and Dimple perfectly compliments him (though she gets proper scope in the final phase of the movie only). Anushka Sharma as the young heroine is lively and energetic and her mere presence infuses life into this serious movie. The complete supporting cast has done well. The presence of many real life Cricketers has added value to the movie. I don't know the names of the actors but I wholeheartedly admire those who have played the roles of young Rishi Kapoor and young Akshay Kumar. Theirs are heart-conquering performances.I recommend this flop and underrated movie to all those Indians (whether settled in India or abroad) who are proud to be so. However when I contrast this movie with the violence presently taking place in London and nearby towns, I wonder whether the filmmaker is right in conveying his message that now there is no ethnic bias against the Indians (or the Asians) in general. Have the times really changed in England ?" 
" Advani lives up to expectations - Again.","Saw the movie last night. Well, definitely worth and more. Like some other poster, I refrain from posting reviews, esp. when you feel that IMDb board, when it comes to Indian Cinema, seems manipulated. Movies like Guzzarrish getting high marks is a perfect example...Patiala house worked for me at several levels. Story was smooth.. Script was tight. Dialogues were crisp. Protag dealing with the demons is well articulated. Anuska's character could have been better developed. Rishi and Dimple play their roles extremely well.Story has momentum. Script and characters have multi-dimension. Father-Son relationship is easier to relate. Generational gaps are well explored. I am a bit surprised to see below 6 ranking bu imdbers.Nikhil does a wonderful job on keeping story fluid and engaging. One of the very few movies that I sat through w/o second guessing. Good job!" 
" Has the potential but falls short","Although I didn't like this film but I must admit that the idea was good . Something new for Bollywood . But that was completely lost in execution . The prime reason is it's incredibly weak script. The character introduction of Bauji was stupid and something you can find in any bollywood film . He himself has left his country and started living in England but don't want his son to play for England . Anyway , the film is not on nationalism . It was about Cricket . And the way the they have shown the national team selection is childish. He comes at the selection on final day , bowls one over and get selected for the National team . That's it . No need for playing first class cricket .And the scenes where they hide the truth from Bauji are not believable. First half is very unsatisfactory . But the film was not that bad . Second half is interesting . It's better than many sports dramas a player can do anything once he sees his family in the crowd . But , the climax is again unconvincing . All actors did a fine job , music was good , camera work was okay but they chose the wrong script.Overall , it is a watchable flick but very unrealistic and logically flawed." 
" Kaali In Cricket","Nikhil Advani creates yet another melodramatic Bollyflick that is 'Patiala House'. Given the script, it actually had potential of being an engaging film that tackles issues like racism, relationships and the cricket craze but Advani succumbs to Bollywood formula with the usual ingredients such as over-the-top characters, intrusive background score, brightly colourful songs, stereotypical clichés, needlessly lavish sets, sentimental scenes, overt patriotism, predictable conclusion and what not. I felt that the attempt to tackle racism was weak. A more subtle and sincere treatment could have made the difference here. Yet, if only mildly, 'Patiala House' is a tad better than the usual formula films that are churned out these days mostly because it raises some important issues (although it fails to tackle them well). Akshay Kumar takes a break from the usual mindless comedy. His performance does remind one of the work he did in awful movies like 'Ek Rishtaa' and 'Waqt, Rage Against Time' and he proves to be competent. It's high time that he chooses a decent film and a role that suits him for a change. One wonders when that's going to happen- Rishi Kapoor seems to have taken over Amitabh Bachchan's tyrannical dad role and he grossly overdoes it. Dimple Kapadia is brilliantly restrained but an actress of her calibre deserved better. Anushka Sharma is vivacious and has a commanding screen presence. 'Patiala House' is forgettable but it's not among the worst Hindi films of the year."
