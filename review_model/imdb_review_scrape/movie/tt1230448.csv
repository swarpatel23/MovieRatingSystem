" Second time","First time i watched the movie it lacked subtitles so i depended on my poor Hindi and emotional body and facial expression. The movie lacked depth to me in its first parts. Till it reached the climax the quality of emotions got some depth. Second time i viewed it my impression got better. The first part was classic Priyadrashan movie which i don't like AT ALL. Most of his films don't leave any mark on me and they slip out of my mind. I was surprised that SRK chose him for such a story that depicts a moral and values we are in desperate need in these days. However, the shooting and photography is brilliant and eye catching. I am a fan of Irrfan and Shahrukh so i got my fill of both. But the last part of the movie meant much more with adequate understanding. I actually cried a lot, especially parts where Sahir recites similar stories of his youth that overlap with shahrukh's himself. I still feel more Irrfan was required, more passionate and sorrowful but i guess its a priyadrashan movie anyway. watch it for the scenery, watch it for Irrfan and SHahrukh.. Lara dutta does a good job too. for once two hours are not enough for the story." 
" Insightful Commentary","Billu Barber, 2009, 138 min, Red Chillies Entertainment An Excerpt Priyadarshan's film produced by Gauri Khan, Billu is the story of a small-town humble barber, from a sleepy Indian village who is having a tough time making ends meet with overdue electricity bills and unpaid school tuition when a film star enters his life with an arrival of Sahir Khan, mega star to town for a shoot. Interestingly, a famous larger-than-life star arrives in town for a shoot sending the village into frenzy as they try to catch the glimpse of the mega-star Sahir Khan, played by non-other than Shahrukh Khan. Billu's poverty-stricken life is contrasted beautifully against the mega star until the face off of the two characters when they finally meet. This is a movie about unconditional childhood friendship, cutting through age, status or fame. At the end, childhood love and friendship heals any wound and bonds broken relationships.What really makes the movie is the character Billu himself, played by Irrfan Khan, surely one of the most talented but underrated actor in Bollywood today. Some of you may remember him from Mira Nair's film Namesake which he gave superb performances as Gogol's father as well as the mean police inspector in Slumdog Millionaire. He is the emotional core of this movie. The film starts with his desperate and innocent attempt to bribe a government officer in order to get a business loan for his barber shop. While listening to his plea, you can't help it but feel for him. Apparently, it is believed that this role was first offered to Ashkay Kumar. I can't imagine him playing this role. Irrfan brings a certain human dignity and respect not only to the character Billu and his profession but also to the life of poverty, convening so much by saying very little. He manages to make his character extremely believable and likable with ease.A surprising and refreshing character is Bindiya, Billu's wife played by Lara Dutt. She should be commended for delivering a captivating and believable performance s; you would not know she is former Miss Universe. This is a different role for her; she usually plays the sophisticated beauty and I might add it is refreshing to see her in this role. The stage presence of both Lara and Irrfan is impressive as husband and wife. She gives the character strength with moments of depth, love and respect which I find very inspiring given their poverty level.What makes this movie great its realism and depiction of rural life in India, unlike other Bollywood movies, with no pretension or smug. The cinematography of this movie is amazing, showcasing the lush of rural India. The simplicity of the film, portrayal of poverty without overwhelming the audience makes this film a delight to watch. I liked the clever way the director unfolds the story. It invites you in, but leaves you to your own considerations as the story progresses. This film lets certain details out when the moments are right, but not before the audience is fully involved in the somber life of small town man. You get the feeling that Billu is lying until the heartwarming climax. Billu is deeply touching not only in details of an ordinary man's life, but also our shortcomings and our insecurities.This film also states that what seems trivial at any given moment in life could be important later on. Besides all this, great acting, thoughtfulness, genuine sincerity, and total emotional honesty are what one can expect from Billu without the loss of a typical grandiose of Bollywood musicals. If you want to see a movie that affirms the meaning of friendship, this is your movie. Billu is extraordinary film in an ordinary town.More commentary on Isisbollywood.wordpress.comRHK, Isisbollywood" 
" are you a good friend and real down to earth person? go watch compare and check yourself !!","Nowadays most films are made to give important message for life so that everyone can connect with it. This film touches one's heart by giving great example of true friendship between two childhood friends.Both friends found themselves in different situation after childhood days of friendship as one became rich while the other remained poor but their bond of friendship was intact in their heart. The poor friend has started believing that his friend might have forgotten him after such a long time and after getting fame and money but in reality that was not the case instead he is still reminding his childhood friend and always wanted to meet him. The character of rich friend shows real down to earth personality of a person and example of true friendship that never fades irrespective of money and fame at the same time the character of poor friend and his wife also shows that being poor never restrict you of being good person.Over all this is very good film and must watch for its heart warming subject of friendship." 
" Billu (Barber) is an excellent watch!","I wasn't sure what to expect when I went to see this movie but I was so pleasantly surprised and pleased with it! Irfan Khan and Lara Dutta deserve nominations for best actor/actress for fine performances. The comedy was just right and the drama was just right. What can I say about Shah Rukh Khan? He is in the perfect role playing the superstar Sahir Khan. He is not just a special appearance in this film but is a main supporting actor so please watch this movie. You won't be disappointed. I also encourage all to please watch this movie on the big screen for the first watch because it makes a huge difference in how you will enjoy this film. When you watch in the theaters, you literally get taken away to another place and trust me, you will enjoy being there for that 2 + hours and wish you didn't have to come back to reality. This movie has a very sweet and sensational story that all ages can enjoy. The music is just superb and you will want to jump out of you seat and dance! Please watch this movie!" 
" In nutshell, "BILLU"- Simple, Honest, Sweet, Descent and Feel good.","Wel..l. Let me clarify one thing i will not comment anything about Storyline as it is already known to most moviegoers; being a remake of Malayalam film. So why should u go for this Hindi remake? There are several strong reasons: 1). Superb acting by all cast- Irfan khan, SRK, Lara Dutta especially Ompuri and Rajapal yadav. 2) eye catching visuals, stunning cinematography. 3) superb Art direction (just look at the entry of "Sahil khan" ). 4) Dialogues are very well written. 5) good music and item songs. 6) a treat for the whole family. 7) Nice moral concept. Over and all, this is nice attempt 2 revive the old concept of friendship by Priyadarshan. Srk has delivered great performance although the character of Sahir Khan was very much similar to him. But it is the Irfan khan who, at the end, grabs most eyeballs. In nutshell "Billu"- Simple, sweet, Honest, Descent and feel good movie...." 
" A Good One To Watch.","When it was first announced that Shahrukh Khan's next film would be this one, many were under the impression that this would be a historical film but it isn't at all. Sometimes we remember our childhood and in particular our friends and the times and various moments at the time. The problem is that we can only remember them once they have gone and they cannot be recreated .This is a simple story which has been portrayed in a most simplistic manner by the makers and the actors. . A Simple man, who owes a lot of money to many and yet people in the village don't want to know him or want to go to his shop has his life turned upside down, when a film company comes to make a film. Starring Irrfan Khan, Lara Dutta, Shahrukh Khan, Asrani, Om Puri, Rajpal Yadav and Manoj Joshi, this is directed by Priyadarshan while Preetam provides the music score. Priyanka Chopra, Kareena Kapoor and Deepika Padukone make special appearances.Even though it stars Shahrukh Khan and has been produced by him and his wife, this is not a typical Shahrukh Khan film but Irrfan Khan instead, as he has done a very good job in his role and it suits him. Lara Dutta has also done a good job in this film as has "King Khan" himself. The special appearances by Priyanka Chopra, Kareena Kapoor and Deepika Padukone add glamour to the story and its worth while watching and listening to the songs that they perform to  the music and the songs are worth listening to. Being a person who has had some experience in photography, the cinematography is worth a mention and must say that this is good and more so where the interior is concerned and also the hills. Regarding certain aspects of movie making, there is also some good comedy and comic situations. The choreography direction includes Shahrukh Khan's friend and director of movies such as "Mein Hoo Na" and "Om Shanti Om," Farah Khan.This has to be one of the better movies this year and is worth watching." 
" OK Movie Worth Watching","The story is simple, but performances of Shahrukh Khan and Irrfan Khan are what makes the movie worth watching. The songs, even though not related to the story, are very entertaining and make the movie more fun to watch. The ending was predictable, but the performances saved the movie.Billu's wife looked way too beautiful to pass off as an average village girl. I'm no Bollywood fan so I did not know who the actress was. Throughout the whole movie, I kept thinking "how on earth did this super hot girl end up with this average looking man?" In the ending credits, I saw Lara Dutta. Miss Universe Lara Dutta!If you have some extra spare time, this movie is good enough not to waste it." 
" Touching..","The climax is special.. It made me cry. No words to describe. Watch it.It's worth watching the development of the main character as it all ends up well. Even those who seem to have nothing, have the biggest thing a human being can have.Every being is before anything else, human. This comes to show that no one is bigger than anyone else. Even the people in the TOP today were down under once. U don't grow alone without any help!For the nostalgia in the end 100/10. For the whole movie 8/10.The songs are nice, gaining fame, although some had no context in the movie." 
" Billu is watchable...but....","There was a time on TV when there were serials like Tenali Rama and Malgudi Days which were innocent, humorous and in the end,they never forgot to give us a sweet little moral teaching. It was a sweet thing which with time disappeared from our televisions.Cut to 2009, we have the son of television ,Shah Rukh Khan producing and acting in a film which attempts to bring the long forgotten innocence of the doordarshan era on celluloid.The film begins well and ends well but I feel there is something which makes Billu , a partial disappointment. May be the box office greed of the producer makes the movie nose dive from being fantastic innocent cinema to just a well tried attempt ,stuffed with unwanted elements.Honestly, the film didn't need those many item numbers and the people who think that ,all the audience wants are skimpily clad bollywood chicks shaking their bodies, are wrong. Terrible. But yeah,Kareena looks wow.Those super hero kinda animations with SRK were not needed either.Surely, SRK is planning to make a sci fi film and those sfx and graphics were an attempt to test the water, but hey please, leave the sci fi projects to the fair skinned film makers.We just don't have that budget .I am not bashing this movie but its just that I am disappointed.I wanted it to be a simple tale with Sahir Khan playing the messiah in the underplayed manner,but here its like, Sahir Khan pretends to hide yet he is flashing a torch.Getting me? The cast is fantastic with Lara looking like a goddess and her acting is great.Irfan who has the title role is magnificent ,but then he is Irfan Khan and he can never go wrong in my opinion.The supporting cast is in sparkling form.Special mention to the guy who plays the guest house manager.His scene where he acts as a policeman during the shooting is one of the most hilarious scenes ever. Scenes involving Om Puri and that school manager are genuinely funny. Loved the Abhay Kumar taunt on Akshay  The locations are great, the songs ,though unwanted are decent and the direction is like any other Priyadarshan film. Nothing special about it. Editing part is pathetic and the scenes jump from one to the other in a haphazard manner.Very unprofessional stuff indeed.The film is watchable because it is different and reminds me of those good ole days of TV.Its a sincere effort and Shah Rukh deserves a pat ,because they just don't make them like it anymore and at least the Khan has tried. Shah Rukh Khan playing himself minus the name is good but give me a re-run of Malgudi Days and I will forget about Billu .7 out of 10 SRK has finally moved away from his target NRI NRP NRB audiences and I am sure that this film will do great business in India because its an honest attempt at a time when cinema shows a stupid cook fighting Chinese warriors and a guy is forgetting everything after 15 minutes yet not forgetting to steal Hollywood concepts Good job srk..Just wish the producer in you didn't have box office in mind...but...." 
" A Nutshell Review: Billu","Billu Barber had already courted some controversy because some hairstylists protested that the term "Barber" was offensive. I don't understand it, but this meant the word has been dropped, and it's now known simply as "Billu", still after its titular character. A remake of the Malayalam film "Katha Parayumpol", Billu is one of those films that work because of its spot-on capturing of the ugliness and greed of man.It opens quite matter of factly with Billu, played by Irrfan Khan, a poor barber in s small village, being down to his last rupee, seeking help from an official knowing that he has to offer a bribe for a loan. Naturally he gets thrown out because of his frankness, and we slowly learn of Billu's immediate challenges - his barber business is down because the state of his shop is run-down, there's a trendier salon opened opposite his, electricity to his small house got cut because of his inability to pay, and the school principal is threatening to throw his kids out of school because the school fees are not forthcoming.And little does he know that his problems will multiply with the coming of a Bollywood film crew for a shoot in their village, turning his entire world as he knows topsy turvy just because he is a friend of India's mega-star, Sahir Khan (incidentally, like the credits say, played by Shah Rukh Khan). This premise puts an interesting dilemma on Billu, because while he is a nobody and a would-be bankrupt, suddenly the village folk start to pay homage to him, from neighbours to rivals to the town's rich miser, because their degree of separation to Sahir Khan is now 2, provided they think, that they had better try and "bribe" Billu by doing favours and giving charity to him, from provision of food, to an overhaul of his shop, so that they can get an opportunity to meet the mega-star up close and personal.To make things worse, Billu's motor-mouth kids and a wife who thought she could now impress the neighbours, start to craft stories of their association, and as we all know, word always get around in a misconstrued manner, thus something innocently said, becomes blown out of proportion. While sometimes the intent is based on perceived noble terms, like accepting the school's bursary in exchange for the star's presence in an anniversary celebration, making false promises puts a question mark on integrity, and worse, the effects are felt by Billu himself, for something that he did not boast about, or craft.My growing list of character actors I admire had included Irrfan Khan ever since I watched his role in The Namesake, and I felt he always had this regal presence, even for short roles such as that in The Darjeeling Limited and Slumdog Millionaire. Here, he brought out the down-to-earthness portrayal of a small village barber trying his best to etch a living and provide for his family, and feeling very out of place with all the unwanted attention showered upon him. We feel his dilemma instantly, as his worries come from it being a very long time since he and Sahir had met, and the unassuming man that he is, believes that he shouldn't impose himself on a friend from the past, in fear of having his friend think that he's clinging onto the coattails of his fame, or worse, to want to ask for favours, which many in the village expect him to do.Much of the film plays around the dilemma, of how people often impose their wishes onto you just because you have the facility to possibly grant their wishes, and rebuttals are often unheeded because people only want to hear what they want to hear, and worse, when assumptions are made. Suddenly you find enemies and casual acquaintances proclaiming themselves to be your new best friends, because of the benefit they can gain from such lip service. And nothing could be worse if these impositions turn out to be from family members - the kids want to meet their idol, and so does the wife (played by Lara Dutta). How can one turn these requests down, when one takes on the role as provider? Shah Rukh Khan looked like he had a field day playing a parody of himself, the film star who happened to share the exact same filmography as himself at that too. Although in a support role, his Sahir comes across as direct and no-nonsense, and having hordes of security and minders around him, makes one wonder who Billu, a man amongst thousands in a crowd, could somehow get him to notice, if it's true he is a friend in the first place! But the role here offers the inevitable opportunity for some staple song-and-dance, and the filmmakers don't let up the chance to pair up SRK some of his more memorable co-stars such as Kareena Kapoor, Priyanka Chopra, and Deepika Padukone, with whom he bursts onto the scene in a futuristic setting for the song Love Mera Hit Hit, the start of Sahir's new movie which ironically is based on an alien's search for his long lost brother in a village.Billu turns out to be a superb balance between fun and an examination of a key negative human condition. I was pretty much entertained throughout, and thanks to the all round fine performances from the cast, Billu is very much enjoyable, and puts itself into the shortlist of one of the fine movies of the year thus far." 
" Irrfan Khan Rises Above A Poor Film That Could Have Been An Interesting Satire","What could have been an excellent satire is brought down by poor writing and Priyadarshan's lousy direction. 'Billu' required some heavy editing. All the sequences with Shahrukh Khan in the first half (including those horrible item numbers) could have easily been left out as they provide nothing. His appearance in the second half was enough. The so-called comic scenes are typical Priyadarshan, which is irritatingly loud and seriously needs toning down. The mob sequences and Billu's attempts to meet Sahir are overdone and repetitive. The ending is melodramatic, which is typical of Priyadarshan films. All the songs are poorly executed and, with the exception of the last three songs ('Marjane' being the best), they are horrible to listen to. Shahrukh Khan plays himself. Nothing new there. Lara Dutta is decent and she looks the part. But, it is Irrfan who manages to rise above the poorness of this movie. He is quite exceptional as the down to earth almost out of work barber and is the reason to watch 'Billu'. Asrani and Om Puri are good in their roles. Rasika Joshi is cast against type and she too turns in a decent performance. The rest of the cast (including Rajpal Yadav) are terrible (which is usually the case in Priyadarshan's films). To sum it up, the best thing about 'Billu' is Irrfan Khan who makes what would be an otherwise bad film to mediocrity." 
" Excellent Family Entertainment","This film has everything you could want in good family entertainment. A solid story line about friendship and trust and how people see or hear what they want and make assumptions. My daughter (10) and son (8) loved it and they don't understand Hindi - we read the subtitles and had a great time.The cinematography is beautiful. The acting is superb. Irrfan Khan plays every emotion to perfection. Lara Dutta shines as the simple village wife. Shahrukh Khan plays, well, himself, or at least a character that is so close to his superstar persona that it's hard to differentiate the two. Lots of tongue-in-cheek references to his other works.The music and item numbers blend well into the plot and are appropriately placed. The costumes flow well with the scenery and match the personalities of the characters and their journeys through the story.We laughed out loud and cried a bit and enjoyed discussing the issues that came up as normal life lessons that we all deal with. This is a must see experience for all." 
" Billu Bhyankar.... is really Bhaynkar!!!","The movie starts of pretty well but like the landing of a plane the movie also goes down and down and down and finale in the climax there is some push.. I don't understand why were the songs added when there were no need and the jokes are not at all making you laugh. I mean if you want to show Shahrukh shooting you can also show him acting why only dancing??..... Priyadrshan is loosing day by day... And Shahrukh should now get mature toward film-making and should produce an sensible script like Aamir Khan does.. His OSO was seriously an dumb script and now Billu has added the flavor!! except the climax and some emotional scenes. there is nothing in the film...Totally disappointing...." 
" Simplicity at its SIMPLE best!","Well... I thought it was another SRK film but surprisingly Shahrukh or 'Sahir' merely has a 15 minute role in this surpriser movie.The story goes simple: out of the blue a film-shooting-unit arrives in a typical village (Budbuda). The lead actor happens to be Sahir Khan, an old-school friend of Billu, one of the two barbers of the village owing a deteriorated barber shop with too few customers to support Billu's family. His children are chucked out of school for non-payment of fees, people are on his head for repayment of borrowed money, and he has none. So when Sahir arrives and word spreads that he is Billu's close friend, everyone chases Billu, gifting him new things (an entire new BARBER shop!!), forgiving his loans, using funds to pay his fees on a simple bet: that Billu help them make acquaintance with the superstar. On the other hand, Billu greatly fears that Sahir may have forgotten him and thus doesn't, at least for some time, make a single attempt to reach out to Sahir.But as his career flourishes and money begins to flow in, Billu realizes that he has no choice but to fulfill the "needs" of the people. Every attempt he makes to reach out to Sahir fails.The film is not about whether or not Billu makes it: find out for yourself. The film focuses greatly on how much of a positive and much-more negative impact the arrival of Sahir has on Billu.The film has other aspects, such as Shahrukh becoming Sahir and using this film as a medium to convey a certain messages about the filming industry and controversies caused to the people.Excellent performances by Irrfan Khan and Lara Dutta. Shahrukh has done simply and satisfying. Nothing great as he is prone to doing in films in which he is the lead actor.My heart was beating badly in the climax - such instances may be felt if you watch the film with your heart and feel for Billu and his wife.The songs are good, soothing. Love Mera Hit Hit is a superb rocker. Khuda Aiyer (forgive my spelling) is a soothing tone and beautiful lyrics.All-in-all, not really a must-watch, but but something not to be missed. 8/10.Go SRK!" 
" Krishna Sudama Story","What a wonderful movie this was. The only drawback is the flashy songs of Sahir Khan (Shahrukh Khan). Irfan Khan performed so well in this movie that it leaves you stunned. Shahrukh Khan was his usual, nothing special. Lara Dutta did a good job in this movie.The movie is very emotional. The last half an hour or so is very emotional. You can't escape from shedding tears. I think the movie should have stayed simple and all the flashy songs and dances should have been spared from the movie. They were nothing but distraction from the core story.Billu (Irfan Khan) and Sahir Khan meeting should have been explored more. It would have been good for Shahrukh if he had played the role of Billu Barber and someone else should have played Sahir's role. Irfan Khan and Lara Dutta stole the show. the movie belongs to them." 
" Billu Barber : Could've been a lot better!!!","Billu Barber, this year's most expected release from the Red Chillies Banner simply turns out to be an ordinary watch. Directed by Priyadarshan, who's known for his Malayalam remakes in Hindi yet again fails to mark the everlasting impression on the audience. Billu Barber definitely looks like a sincere effort to make everyone like the movie. The movie starts off with low pace and just when you feel the movie is catching pace,the curtains are down.Billu Barber's protagonist Billu(Irfan Khan) is a petty barber from the village called Budbuda who struggles to earn every penny but still somehow manages to make a living supporting his family. He's simple, humble and a character that everyone in Budbuda loves. His destiny changes when, the film-star Sahir Khan(Shahrukh Khan) lands in Budbuda for the shooting of his film. Billu is then pestered by his children to go meet him,to whom he had once said Sahir Khan was his childhood friend. Things go out of hand when the news of Billu being the childhood friend of Sahir reaches every corner of Budbuda. Billu then refuses to accept the fact that he once knew Sahir, assuming that he wouldn't recognize their childhood friendship now. He's then mocked up by villagers for making such a fool of himself. The things leading up to him meeting Sahir Khan is for you to watch for yourself.Billu Barber's heart and soul is Irfan Khan. He's quite stupendous in the very first commercial movie that claims to put him as the main lead. His funny, serious and emotional shades are quite perfectly done. He's bang on with his performance as always. The highlight of the movie is the acting of Lara Dutta who plays Billu's wife. This is when you actually come to know, how important the script and the character are in making an actor give his-or-her best. Lara Dutta is extremely good giving her career best in BB. As always,Screenplay and dialogues of Billu Barber are something that's a little carelessly done as compared to the previous release of Red Chillies OSO that scored almost in every department. Shahrukh Khan does his bit of acting convincingly. The actors like Rajpal Yadav and Om Puri are let down with ordinary dialogues, who still try creating humor that goes totally unnoticed. The movie lacks the energy that a typical Shahrukh Khan movie usually tends to generate. The special appearances by Deepika, Kareena and Priyanka is good but lets you forget as continue watching the movie. Though the money is spent lavishly on the sets, the film fails to deliver the expectations of the audience. The Music of the movie is not appealing either. Billu Barber scores an mediocre rating in every department.I will go with 6 out of 10 for Priyadarshan's Billu Barber.Not a must watch. But go with no expectations and you might not be disappointed."
