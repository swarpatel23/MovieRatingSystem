" Satire that would have had more success with a bigger cast","The film is a good satire. Although it may drag a little, it manages to successfully depict society's religious beliefs. It is this compulsion with religion that - ironically - reduces it to a money-making medium that ruins human relationships.Had this film a had bigger cast, it would have had more success and positive reception.With its dark humour, this film is a more satirical version of PK with Aamir Khan.Definitely worth a watch. It's better than what you think it is!" 
" Humorous with a different theme","I saw Yeh Hai Bakrapur on You Tube yesterday. Hadn't ever heard of it before. Surprisingly it came up on a "latest Bollywood comedy full movie online" search even though it released in 2014.Anyway I started watching, it held my interest and provided more than a small measure of humour, not to mention the human interest story.I loved the setting. Seemed to be on location in some dilapidated ruined habitation in rural India. I guessed somewhere on the Deccan plateau but the language was not of that region. Anyway, wherever it was, was very realistic.The story is of a little boy's goat Shahrukh (yes really!) that his family intended to sell to pay off their debts. A young male hairdresser who is romantically involved with the little boy's sister, saves the goat in an imaginative way that enriches the family ..... and the story continues ......Overall this is a nice film, beautifully shot, with a very different theme and well enough enacted by the largely unheard of cast. I enjoyed watching it and I wish it had better publicity. Yeh Hai Bakrapur is much better than a lot of the better promoted well known star cast mediocre fare that is churned out."
