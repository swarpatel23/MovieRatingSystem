" Touching","I dont know know why this film has been rated low. It is one of the best films with simple storyline and emotional content." 
" Strong acting breathes life in to a routine theme.","The director duo that came out of with disappointing movies like 'The killer' and 'The Train', do deserve some recognition and credit for being capable of making a normal movie. This also happens to be a vishesh movie production. The factor that actually makes this movie succeed in grabbing attention is the performances from all involved. The plot is nothing original or groundbreaking. However the actors involved make the movie worth watching. Vishesh films had built a reputation of launching newcomers continuously. All the actors in this movie have acted before so there was no amateur performances to be subjected to, which was a relief.The basic story has been repeated many times before. But when one gives the movie a re watch, you can appreciate the quality aspects a bit more. The theme is about how a common individual aspires to achieve a dream to become something. But continues to struggles despite challenges and problems that are at the surface. As well as a this there is also the moral message of living an honest life and realising ones inner potential. *****SPOILER***** In this scenario there is Adhyanan Suman and Shahana Goswami who play brother and sister Adhyanan aspires to become a music singer and finds love too with Anjana Sukhani. Meanwhile Shahana is supporting her living by having an acquaintance with a rich married man. Living a 9 to 5 life does not suit her. However relations between brother and sister runs in to deep waters when the rich man discovers that his sister (Anjana) is in love with Adhyanan. As a result of this Adhyana leaves home and decides to move in with his friends and continue to achieve his aim. Anjana too supports him. Shahana also has a awakening and decides to make a attempt to live an honest life.*****END OF SPOILER*****The elements that truly stand out in the movie is the performances, direction and dialogues. Shahana's scenes are the highlight in the movie. Whenever she appears on screen it is fantastic. She is a actress in her own class. She overshadows everybody else. Her screen presence is just mesmerising. The has great potential. I could only wish she will be seen in more movies in the near future. Adyanan has improved in one step more after Raaz 2. Anjana is good as usual. The treatment given to a simple story is impressive. How it has been conveyed in a subtle manner and not over glamorised makes the presentation unique." 
" The Music Within hums its way to the surface!","Jashnn for the most part is quite a well made film- it's a pretty typical Bollywood affair but one that won't have you rolling your eyes around too much. But several shortcomings prevents this from being an excellent movie.Rather than running with a completely original idea the directors went the tried and tested way which means having several well worn clichés- the day dreaming hero who tears up at the drop of a hat, a villain that you dislike upon sight, even before he says a word, a bombshell heroine, and the clichéd ending.One may wonder how then this merits a favourable review but thankfully the movie doesn't go the typical route with the 50 band troupe song and dance that appears out of nowhere, nor are there pointless action scenes.The story is well captured in the emotions of the actors- you feel for them when they're down as their problems are problems that we could and probably would face in reality. Well, apart from the main hero who cries a bit too much which gets very old and annoying after a while.But the main success of the movie is the music- very nice tunes and beats and I surprised myself by watching and listening to every song. The music has a rock like edge to it and worthing listening to- especially Nazarein Karam.Actingwise no real complaints here- everyone did a decent job and if there were any failings it was because of the loose and dull script. So I guess you can't blame the main actor for crying to much- he did so because it was written in the screenplay to do so! One hangup I had concerned the romance track which was not handled all that well. It seemed that after one meeting and a song true love somehow blossomed between the lead couple which was not explained properly nor developed very well. Another thing- the hero falls in love at first sight...and yet the lead actress looked no different from any other Indian girl so what made her so special? This part was poorly handled and not very believable. I think its high time that Bollywood directors depict attraction in a more realistic fashion.Finally, if anything ruined the overall enjoyment it's the ending. This is a spoiler free review so I won't discuss any plot points but suffice it to say that the first half was decent apart from the villain script blip which was as old as the hills. The second half started fine but suffered from a slowdown from something the main hero does and then the ending is so clichéd that I actually forwarded to the end credits.So, in conclusion a mostly fun fare which hits some road bumps in the form of a clichéd script, a typical Bollywood ending (which not a good thing) and some predictable twists. But the music serves as a nice distraction to make this a Sunday evening time pass."
