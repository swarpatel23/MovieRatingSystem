" a noir-otic comedy.","the film has all elements of being a dark comedy. most characters are anti heroes. doing whatever it takes to get money. the narrative style is also interesting. the non linear sequence gave it a nice touch. the movie could have done it without songs, the background score is topnotch. cinematography could have been much more stylish for a dark comedy but it just did bare minimum. the director solely relied on story, actors and dialogues. the film, after setting plot, takes a good turn which sets falling dominoes in motion, it's amazing how film unfolds unexpectedly. it keeps you on the edge till it ends. anticipation and suspense keeps it going. vinay pathak and ranvir shourey in their combo duo roles fit perfectly and deliver some funny lines. kalki as a charming girl keeps it cool and underplays it's part just as it was needed. Anand Tiwari as hiten, the gujrati is refreshing, he acts funny - just amazing. the trio with ravi kishan also does justice to their characters. the climax was great and as with Indian philosophy or movies it is one who deserves it gets it.only thing that ticked me off is it's title - if they had come up with an apt title - a large audience could have seen this. well, kudos to director for a quality debut." 
" Enjoyable, Simple movie","The movie's title is quite ambiguous, as there is a popular stupid TV show called 'The Emoional Attyachar season 2'. This movie has, thankfully, nothing to do with that show, there is no much reason for the title, except for one emotional cheating. The movie makes us confused in the first hour, with some characters and their lives, but no interconnection between the scenes But in the latter half, the movie unfolds in a beautiful manner, and by the time everything is clear to the audience, we might also have got attached with at least some of the characters of the movie.Coming to the performances, everybody did decent jobs, Vinay Pathak, Ranvir Shorey, Kalki Koechlin, Ravi Kishan, Mohit Ahlavat all did well. Ravi Kishan is getting stereotyped to this kind of roles, suits him, though.. The goons with Ravi Kishan was also good, don't know their names The movie is a different approach, try watching it I am not saying it's a must watch and all, but still, enjoyable movie" 
" Treacherous but Emotional Atyachar","Treacherous but Emotional Atyachar A Dark, Gloomy Road movie where is EA?After watching the movie you will wonder why the title Emotional Atyachar, with a prefix 'the film'. That too after winning a lawsuit against UTV movies that air a reality shows by the same name, of course without the prefix. "Emotional Atyachar" is not every one's cup of tea. The movie takes a leap out from Guy Ritchie's gore and dark humor with blood splurging like Quentin Tarantino's movies.Definitely Akshay Shere had watched "Lock Stock and two smoking barrels" and "Snatch", but guys this one is original and not a copy. The thriller is stitched with vendetta and slack humor. As Taran Adarsh said:-"One has to be attentive, sorry, very attentive while watching The Film Emotional Atyachar. This one's not the leave-your-brains-at-home types, for sure. The story of the film is truly hatke and its execution, double hatke. In fact, it takes time to grasp the goings-on initially because the characters aren't connected with one another and also, there're multiple stories running concurrently."The non-linear story line and an abrupt time-scale will keep you glued to your seat till first half, then the story will unfold to a filmi- unpredictable but comfortable ending. Akshay has definitely learned from Ram Gopal Varma, being his assistant director in the classic Sarkar and a good Shiva. Moreover the actors are either from RGV's factory or Anurag kashyap's Camp.Anand Tiwari scores full after learning from Slumdog millionaire, Udaan and Mumbai meri jaan. He is too good in all the small roles, focusing on ethical and moral accomplice of the clan who is very far away from the same. A noticeable act and well done.The Duo is back with a bang again, their chemistry that too dark one is something to cherish. Yes, Ranvir-Vinay are the king of humors. The dialogues and monologues' between them are complimenting each other and a pleasure to watch. While Abhimanyu Singh was wasted like a virgin gangster wearing Ed-hardy T shirts and drinking beer. Whatever small role was given to him as an incompetent casino Casanova was played well. Ravi Kissen is always good in Tapori lingo and his character was too dark. Snehal Dabhi entertains us with his fat body and acts. Mohit Ahlawat is looking shady and innocent like always and good to watch. A job done with perfection. The only female character, Kalki was good as a charming, flirtiest.There is a scene which can inspire Pulp-Fiction, a scrappy knife looking for a bullet but yields everything else from the bodyA very nicely captured scene. The camera-work is perfect with some wide angle CCTV look and top shots. The background score too supports the camera in a subtle way. There is only one unnecessary short song; however it didn't distract the movie. Kartik Krishnan's dialogues are great and punched with some hard hitting humor.At par with Johnny Gaddar, a perfect watch for those who would like edgy and knack of raw & dark movies.Oops Did i miss Reservoir Dogs !!!??" 
" A Well-Done Comic Thriller!","Akshay Shere's 'The Film Emotional Atyachar' is A Well-Done Comic Thriller! It springs a pleasant surprise, it catches the viewer's attention & delivers efficient entertainment. It's certainly not meant for those who love escapist cinema, but its definitely a satisfying watch for those who adore 'realistic cinema'. 'The Film Emotional Atyachar' Synopsis: A businessman runs into corrupt police officers and gangsters after procuring a bag full of cash'The Film Emotional Atyachar' works because The Screenplay is smart & arresting. Though I must add, that, the culmination doesn't work. It lacks the impact it ought to have had. But the pluses are undeniable, it serves an interesting story about multiple characters. Akshay Shere's Direction is very good. Cinematography is skilled. Editing is sharp. Performance-Wise: Vinay Pathak is outstanding. He plays the corrupt cop with rare ease. Ranvir Shorey supports Vinay, wonderfully. Kalki is natural to the core. Ravi Kishan is terrific. His portions are expertly handled. Mohit Ahlawat is fair. Abhimanyu Singh is superb. Snehal Dhabi & Anand Tiwari lend great support. On the whole, 'The Film Emotional Atyachar' is a worthy watch." 
" Monetary Turmoil","Hindi cinema should definitely make more black comedies. Even though 'The Film Emotional Atyachar' isn't without its share of downs, it's much better than most Hindi films I've seen this year, and certainly way better than the comedies. Ranvir Shorey and Vinay Patak have done some awesome movies together (e.g. 'Dasvidaniya','Mithya' etc) and some not so good ones like 'Aaja Nachle' but my expectations were high for this one because it wasn't some Yashraj junk.The problem with 'The Film Emotional Atyachar' is in the first half. Although one can assume that the subplots are linked, they appear random. The story doesn't seem to have any direction and the non-linear telling is confusing sometimes.The jokes work well and the film picks up in the second half. Where acting is concerned, Vinay Pathak, Ranvir Shorey, Abhimanyu Singh, Anand Tiwari, Snehal Dabi and Ravi Kishan (he's becoming typecast) are excellent. Mohit Ahlawat and Kalki Koechlin are competent.'The Film Emotional Atyachar' may not be the best in Hindi comedy but it's worth a one-time watch and has enough to make one laugh." 
" Underrated","The Film: Emmotional Atyachar is a black comedy. For a debut film, Akshay Shere has done a wonderful job of holding the complicated screenplay together and keeping it light hearted. His casting is just perfect as well. The first half goes about in a non-linear narrative establishing the characters and their motives. After the unexpected shoot out that takes place at a pub the plot gains a momentum that continues right till the end. Hilarious one liners by Vinay and Ranvir keep you in splits and so does the track of Ravi Kishen and his two newbies. The climax however could have been more edgy. The All is Well ending takes away some bit of thrill.A Good Effort My rating 2.5/5"
