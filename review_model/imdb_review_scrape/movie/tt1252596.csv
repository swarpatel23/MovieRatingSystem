" Very romantic, like a dream.","Go for this movie without any expectations, then you will like it. This movie is taken like a dream. All the scenes are shot in an unnatural color and contrast and all the dialogues are unnatural as well. Many of friends who like normally those movies which have more natural touch, did not like this movie at all. But if you are ready to take this movie as a sequence of sweet, soft and dream like scenes, then this is surely a movie for you. Trust me you will like it.The best scene of the movie is when Katrina reveals about her love to Ranbir, he gets shock of his life time and he keeps his hand on his chest and falls down from the balcony. This scene is shot with one of the best camera angle I have seen. I just loved the scene.The background score and songs are really brilliant. For awards, if they consider those who make the songs close to the mood of the movie, then Pritam, Salim Sulaiman, Irshad Kamil, Ashiesh Pandit and Hard Kaur really reserve recognition for this work. The songs and background score are very well mixed with movie.Katrina Kaif performed her role very nicely. Always, when it comes to a doll like character, Katrina is a safe bet (as long as there is not much emotions to be expressed). Ranbir also did the role quite good. But I some how have a problem with his body shape. Since he is having very thin waste, he looks like a triangle pointing down with a head on it, in some dresses. Either he should reduce the mass on his hand muscles to like thinner on top also or he should be careful with his dress selection. Other actors were also OK in the movie. Nobody did anything wrong.Only one scene which I did not like at all in this movie was the scene in which all these guys trying to convince Upen Patel's father for his marriage using a lot of blood. That scene was quite boring and irritating and was very long as well.I am going to give a 8 on 10 for this movie, since I really liked it. I have an advice, try to see this movie only if you are a person who does not look for real life inspirations in movies, other wise you are going to hate this movie like anything." 
" Ranbir rocks in this fun rom-com!","This movie is great fun--Ranbir is easily the show-stealer! He has acted superbly and is definitely on a winning streak! He has given great performances in all of his films--from Saawariya and Bachchna Ae Haseeno to Wake Up Sid and APKGK--even though all characters are quite similar (happy-go-lucky romantic fools who love life). Ranbir pulls off this role with excellent comic timing! Katrina looks really beautiful, while there's nothing really to mention about her acting. Upen is just okay. Salman's special appearance is a fun scene. Prem's parents also gave wonderful performances. Songs are great, especially Pyaar Hua. The music video of Tu Na Jaane is also really nice. The only thing I didn't like about this film are the sequences with the don and gangsters, which had pretty dumb humor. Those scenes had no importance and were only a deterrent to the film. Other than that, the film is a fun one and belongs to Ranbir." 
" The funny story of a strange love","I went to watch Ajab Prem Ki Ghazab Kahani simply because I liked most of Rajkumar Santoshi's movies. This movie is nowhere as good as some of Santoshi's great films like Damini, Lajja or The Legend of Bhagat Singh, but despite its flaws, it is very entertaining and is thoroughly fun to watch. Yes, it has its clichés and moments of over-romanticism which really get on one's nerves, but the movie works best as a crazy comedy which never dares to take itself too seriously, and that's where it scores. The film is often silly but that's the trick here because everything works in accordance with the film's mood.Some of the film's comic proceedings were totally great, whether it's the Salman Khan track, the entire party scene, the scenes showing Ranbir's parents and so forth. There were sequences which were unnecessary and did not make sense, such as the entire gangsters track. Where drama and romance go, the movie is good but something is missing, although it had its moments there too. One of the best aspects about the film is undoubtedly Pritam's excellent soundtrack which consists of such songs as the beautiful "Tu Jaane Na", the romantic "Tera Hone Laga Hoon" and the catchy "Prem Ki Nayya".As far as acting is concerned, it is Ranbir, Ranbir and only Ranbir who carries the film on his shoulders and delivers a sincere performance. The role itself is actually nothing new or special but Ranbir ably turns Prem into someone who is both funny and easy to relate to. Katrina Kaif is a pretty and attractive lady and overall she is effective within the context of the film, but in terms of acting, though she has her moments, she never really manages to totally convince or impress. Smita Jaykar and Darshan Jariwala, who play Ranbir's parents, are awesome. All said and done, Ajab Prem Ki Ghazab Kahani is not extraordinary, but it's very enjoyable and an altogether fun romantic comedy which can be watched with family and friends." 
" Dying is easy, comedy is hard...as proved by this film",""Dying is easy, comedy is hard" the British actor Donald Wolfit supposedly quipped on his deathbed. And how true it is! This is borne out in "Ajab Prem ki Ghazab Kahani", the new film by Raj Kumar Santoshi. It starts out promisingly enough with Pop Art credits in the cheery primary hues beloved of Roy Lichtenstein. But if one thinks this hip opening is how the film will proceed, one would be way off the mark.This romantic comedy is only fitfully funny, and too long drawn out to be amusing. Santoshi's cast resorts to extensive mugging and slapstick antics in the hope that they will be construed as light frothy madcap comedy. The film's male lead, Ranbir Kapoor, an extremely talented and likable young man, is set adrift without good lines and a leading lady, who though abundantly blessed with vapid good looks, is quite at a loss when she is required to act.Ranbir Kapoor plays Prem, the good-for-nothing, good-natured leader of Happy Club. Luckily, he happens upon a group of young men considerably dimmer than he, and sets himself up as their leader. His followers look up to him admiringly and always address him as President, and he never leaves home without his name tag: President Prem.The Happy Club—always the look-out for new members—aims to be happy, make everyone else around happy, have fun, and unite star-crossed lovers. Despite these simple yet lofty aspirations, the townsfolk do not look kindly upon the club members, as they have had ample experience of their freeloading ways.In the course of a botched kidnapping to fulfill their mandate of reuniting lost loves, President Prem meets Jennifer (Katrina Kaif), the fair and flaky adoptive daughter of the Goan Catholic Pinto family that has just moved into town. Pretty, dimwitted Jenny becomes the town's librarian (it's all relative, you see: she probably has an IQ in the double digits), and Prem drops by to visit, but cannot be coaxed into doing any reading. When he discovers she is single, Prem promptly falls in love with her, and spends the rest of his days in adoring puppy dog fashion, getting underfoot and practically stalking her, but never actually declaring himself.This being a "masala" Hindi film, there are complications and coincidences aplenty, and they go on and on until one is past caring. Both Prem and Jenny stammer when under emotional stress, and the audience is meant to discern through this device when they are playacting and when they are speaking the truth.Let it never be said that I am a mean-spirited or ungenerous film critic: Katrina Kaif is very pretty, has a creamy complexion and looks good enough to eat with a spoon; she is probably a fine upstanding citizen, donates selflessly to worthy causes, always remembers to moisturize daily, brakes for the handicapped and small furry animals, and no doubt eschews the use of aerosol sprays because they release toxic fluorocarbons into the atmosphere. In short, Katrina Kaif is a paragon of virtue and goodness.Sadly, however, she will never be mistaken for an actress. Her line readings are almost painful to the ear, but every once in a great while, almost by fluke, she gets a nuance right, startles herself, then looks beseechingly into the camera, imploring the audience to applaud her teeny-tiny microscopic iota of success as a thespian. Ranbir makes valiant attempts to be funny and act for both of them, and later, upon the introduction of an untalented muscle-bound interloper, for the three of them. No filmi hero should be required to do so much heavy lifting, and despite his best efforts, Ranbir is simply not man or actor enough to act for THREE people.Mercifully, the supporting cast is much stronger than its female lead, and they contribute some much needed silliness to the proceedings.After prolonged meanderings, the couple ends up in the fearsome villain's lair that charmingly resembles a giant bubble bath. Here, finally, there is some entertaining giddiness, but it's too little, too late. Even divine intervention by our blessed Redeemer Himself in a gentle cameo doesn't quite manage to save the film." 
" best 2009 bollywood comedy - andaz R.K.Santoshi ka!!","well if you think that raj kumar santoshi has recreated andaz apna apna's magic, answer is NO!! but the movie is worth to watch twice for RANBEER KAPOOR, some cracking comedy, romantic & emotional situations. Ranbeer has carried the movie all along on his shoulders with charming katrina kaif in a delightful manner. some of its parts are repetitive. The film is co-written and directed by raj kumar santoshi, salman khan is in special appearance, shot at scenic Ooty. its a funny romantic movie which reflects the true bollywood color after a long time. it is Prem's(Ranbir Kapoor) story who is a 9th standard drop-out from a middle class Hindu family. He falls in love with a Christian girl Jenny(Katrina Kaif). Prem whose main job is being the President of the Happy Club. The happy club hopes to make people happy but mostly its members boast about doing nothing. Jenny is a adopted orphan. Prem is never able to propose Jenny and finally finds out that Jenny loves Rahul(Upen Patel) but Jenny's parents wants her to get married to Tony. Santoshi keeps it light, fluffy and fun till the climax. The last scene on Jesus makes the best possible end. There is a real sweetness in the some scenes. Three out of five stars from my side." 
" A fresh comedy film...","Go and watch this film if you are supposed to see a fresh comedy film of this year... Rajkumar Santoshi has really made a film watchable with family in the time when comedy meant adult comedy only!!!He again showed that he is full of talent after giving flop films. He worked really well. The heart of the film is the chemistry between Ranbir Kapoor and Katrina Kaif. They both are just outstanding in the film. It doesn't seen in the film that Ranbir is a new comer in the industry. It was said for Kat that she is beautiful but not a good actress. She got chances and again she proved herself in this film that she is a good actess also. Both Ranbir and Katrina are youth icons. If you are crazy and young then don't miss this film." 
" Didn't meet ma expectations","OK people here is the first review of this movie. A long awaited movie by many people. watched the flick because of Ranbir Kapoor and Katrina Kaif waster 175/- for the premiere and to say that the movie didn't match the expectations. There are some comedy scenes like Ranbir dancing so that he can be the dancing partner of Katrina which is hilarious.Other than that some scenes have been copied from Andaz apna apna, like the Don falling from the stairs and the final climax scene ( if you remember Andaz apna apna then Gogo fell down from the stairs ) Songs are good especially Tu jaane Na... Beautifully pictured." 
" Finally!","Well I didn't expect too much from this film. Its a romantic comedy for sure. We could see that from the trailer. These days I don't expect too much from a Hindi film.They have a huge star casts, excellent location, beautifully pictured songs, but they lack in story and editing. But i can say after "Love Aaj Kal", this year APKGK is a treat to watch. I am not saying its a perfect film, but its a pleasure for heart. If you want to have a good laugh then APKGK is the film for you.After a long time I found that in a Hindi film which is not trying to portray its surroundings real. You know from the first scene that its a fiction. R.K Santoshi made it very clear.Its a movie where anything can happen and they don't want to make you believe its real. Its up to you to believe! I am not going to compare it with Andaz Apna Apna. It was one of a kind. There is no Amir Khan and Salman Khan in APKGK instead we have this Ranvir Kapoor with amazing comic timing! He was superb in the film! Reminded me of Hrithik Roshan in Kaho Na....! Ranvir was so fresh and his chemistry with Katrina Kaif was wonderful! Bollywood have a new on screen couple who compliments each other. And I figured it out later that there is no romantic scenes (except two songs and a conversation in dream!) between the two, but they looked amazing whenever they were together. And the nicest thing about this movie is its decency! Mr. Santoshi (he is also the co writer) didn't use "sex" or "homosexuality" for comedy! Bollywood should learn!Songs were really nice! Pritam did a good job! I fell in love with the song "Tera Hone Laga Ho" and "Tu Jane Na". Katrina looked really pretty and real for the first time.It was a nice film with an amazing cast(including the supporting actors, except Upen Patel!). Amazing locations (Goa and Ooty looked awesome)and amazing punches! Its a comedy after all!" 
" Refreshingly funny light entertainer","When the creator of the inimitable and unforgettable Andaz Apna Apna ventures to beat the 'Davids' & Goliaths of Bollywood's Comedy genre at their own game, one needs to take RajKumar Santoshi seriously. With 'Ajab Prem Ki Ghazab Kahani' (APKGK), Santoshi achieves what most have failed at – a fresh comedy with humour that is actually funny. Not that APKGK is flawless but there are more laughable scenes and dialogues than many comedies of recent times put together and for that, the movie is a wholesome entertainer. It does come with weird, inexplicable moments of unnecessary action, drama and slapstick and there is always scope for better comedy in those scenes but in the end, the dialogues, performances and several scenes make it an almost 'Ghazab' kahani. Prem(Ranbir Kapoor) is the President of a Happy Club founded with his friends in a little town like Ooty to help estranged lovers and helpless souls. His encounter with the beautiful Jenny (Katrina Kaif) starts out as a riotous mix up that leads to him falling for her (literally, at times). This love story is partly sweet, partly cheesy but overall very refreshing because of the amazing chemistry of the duo that seems completely at home in their comic avatars. The movie will make you giggle, chuckle and even laugh your ass of as Prem attempts to win Jenny's heart. Enter Upen Patel One big problem with APKGK is its casting. Most actors would live just to act in RajKumar Santoshi's comedy film but he decided to cast Upen Patel out of all people. This guy still cannot speak fluently and can barely stand straight. One can think of at least 43 actors who could've done so much better than him. Govind Namdeo as his father is also typecast as either a wicked policeman or a crooked politician. This time his role takes away the humour from the film. Darshan Jariwala as Prem's father is very impressive and his dialogue delivery at times elevates a simple humorous scene to make it memorable. Katrina Kaif looks gorgeous in the simplest of outfits and she is more comfortable smiling, laughing and crying than many actresses who struggle with it. Her dialogue delivery has improved considerably, thus augmenting the chemistry with her hero. Ranbir Kapoor has enjoyed this film. One can see that he doesn't need to act as his character most of the time. He is a natural actor in that sense, much like his father and this film establishes him, yet again as the finest of his generation. His comic timing is super and it would really be a treat to watch him perform with veteran actors in more funny movies. Pritam's musical score rocks again. This time, he combines the distinct talents of Jaaved Ali, Neeraj Shridhar, KK, Hard Kaur and Atif Aslam in a soundtrack with different moods and themes. Jaaved Ali in a romantic Aa Jao Meri Tamanna, Hard Kaur in Follow Me with Ranbir's eccentric dancing, KK in Main Tera Dhadkan Teri at his usual best, Neeraj in a rather funny Prem ki Naiya, Atif Aslam & Alisha Chinoy in the marvelous Tera Hone Laga Hoon and a solo by Atif in a soulful Tu Jaane na shot in spectacular locales of Turkey while the rest of the film was shot in Goa. Santoshi does that. Remember he shot Pukar on a set and took the actors to the glaciers of Alaska for one song. In terms of noteworthy flaws, a recurring problem that is noticed is the amateur editing. The scenes jump from one sequence to another without transition or meaning. Some inane sequences drag longer than they should and drama overpowers the subtlety. Santoshi too is to be blamed for the witless opening sequence, the climax action that is reminiscent of Andaz Apna Apna but nowhere even close, the ridiculous sporadic action sequences and the inapt casting. Yet, APKGK is worth watching for the numerous scenes and dialogues that are fresh in flavor, witty in humour and enjoyable due to some fine performances mainly by Ranbir, Katrina and Jariwala. While one tries to recollect the previous funny one liner while watching the film, another one just pops up and believe it or not. that is rare in movies these days. 7.99 on a scale of 1-10." 
" was this funny?","when you watch a Hindi movie especially a comedy movie i know not to expect much of a good story.But this movie tested all the limits,i mean what was this all about,was this funny at all.There should be some story for keeping the audience interested , do the filmmakers even care for it.The characterization was horrible, and there's not comic relief whatsoever except for 2 or 3 scenes.Why cant the Hindi film industry make at least one intelligent or forget intelligence at least completely entertaining comedy movie in the likes of hera pheri. Please i suggest to all of you don't watch this movie and get bored and waste your money.The are some many other world movies worth watching. Help your self by not watching it." 
" Comedy - good, Katrina - super, Ranbir - superb!","It's been a long time since I saw a Rajkumar Santoshi movie, the last being Khakee. I must say APKGK is a fun flick that assures you of nice entertainment in a cinema hall. Its a mindless story which I think is precisely the point. The aim is to just give you a good time.Pros ~ Lots of rib-tickling comedy with a few drops of emotional moments, nice songs and an endearing performance from Ranbir Kapoor gives this movie a thumbs up. Darshan Jariwala as Ranbir's dad is the other who wins our heart with his act. Katrina was cool. She has it to be a No.1 Bollywood actress(in terms of commercial success) and special mention also goes to the actors who play Ranbir's close buddies.Cons ~ Some silly comedy here & there. Probably, Rajkumar thought that one must also try too hard to make audience laugh or else box office collections could cry! Verdict - Whether you are a Ranbir fan, Katrina fan or someone who would like to sit back & experience a stress buster(chopped, cooked & served in right proportions), this movie has it all." 
" Nothing great","RKS a name that was taken with respect since some time back after he gave us the memorable GHAYAL(1990), DAMINI(1993), the not successful yet a cult status ANDAZ APNA APNA(1994), THE LEGEND OF BHAGAT SINGH(2002), KHAKEE(2004)He also is instrumental in giving national awards to Sunny(GHAYAL, DAMINI), Ajay(TLOBS) and Anil(PUKAR)So coming to this filmWell sadly post KHAKEE, RKS gave craps like FAMILY(2006) which was panned critically and also was a flop and then HALLA BOL(2008) which was too outdated and flopped and also was pannedNow he finds the formula for success I feel he searched a lot and finally went through some recent romantic comedies and Phew! he comes with one So sad, nowdays RKS is such following the trend set by other peopleHe got the mantra: Cast an actor who is coming up as a star- Ranbhir and cast Katrina an actress who without acting and just beauty can make a film work Start showing the songs many times on TV which make the film work and also the comedy scenes Nothing wrong in this but sadly the film ends up being a rubbish movieThe comedy is so stupid that even David and Priyadarshan's comedies seem better, The romance is missingThe problem with the film as shown in the promos itself is there is nothing to watch out for just some comedy scenes and some outdated romance scenes and punctuate them with songs.etc We also have a guest role by Salman Khan to make the film a hit Poor guy he is having bad days as a hero himself And then Upen Patel in the second half The film starts off as a 90's romantic comedy and becomes an Anees bazmee type confusion and ends up in a chase type comedyDirection by RKS is ordinary Music is a rage, all songs are niceAmongst actors Ranbhir Kapoor after WUS is decent, his role however is nothing different but yet he does a good job katrina is as usual Darshan Jariwala, Smita Jaykar are adequate Salman is as usual, Upen Patel is nonsense" 
" A good romantic comedy film","Rajkumar Santoshi has given the bollywood film industries a lot of serious films over the last couple of years for e.g Family: Ties of Blood, Halla Bol etc. But now he returns to make another comedy flick in the form of Ajab Prem Ki Ghazab Kahani. his early comedy film which was Andaz Apnaa Apnaa was a great hit and is one of my favorite comedy movies of all of time. The same however cannot be exactly said about APKGK but it is still a very good effort on the part of santoshi.Ranbir kapoor once again proves why acting is in his blood by giving another show stealing performance he play the character of prem so well that you will end up falling in love with the character by the end of the movie. Katrina Kaif also proves why she is one of the best bollywood actresses of this generation with her performance in this film and new york she proved that she can play both a comic and a serious role in a film. The supporting cast also does a fine job Upen Patel was decent he was not involved enough in the plot enough to get any big sort of recognition. Govind Nao was OK still feel like his character was completely destroyed in this film however the people who played Prem's friends and his parents still deliver good performances.The plot of the film is decent it is just another love story between a boy and a girl who meet, become JUST friends and the boy suddenly falls in love with the girl but can't confess, the girl loves him but she doesn't realize it and finally does after the boy leaves her forever and she misses him and feels lonely that is when she realizes that she really loves him. Well at least the plot is not a rip off of another romantic film which the bollywood industry seems to do very often.The comedy is silly and over the top but it will make you laugh and entertain you nonetheless. Santoshi proves that he will go to any limits to make his audience laugh and entertain them. It is very hard to make the audience of this generation laugh very easily, silly over the top comedy wouldn't work so well but this film will still make you laugh more than any other comedy film has done in the last few years. the romance is the film is only captured during two songs during the movie and the dream sequence between Ranbir and Katrina and by the end of the film. But the on screen chemistry between the lead couple is fantastic.ALl the songs in the movie are awesome apart from Prem Ki Nayaa which is decent. All the songs in the movie have beautiful lyrics and music and amazing singers like Javed Ali and Atif Aslam. The soundtrack of this movie is definitely one of the finest Bollywood movie soundtracks to come out this year.Overall APKGK is very good film which has a very good and funny first half but pales and drags in the second, the comedy is still over the top and silly but will still make you laugh, there is not much romance in the movie but the on screen chemistry lives up for that. So overall i would say despite its flaws this was a very entertaining and good movie and one of the better bollywood movies to come out this year.8/10" 
" A Must Watch,at least for cine-goers","So the film starts in a rather in-apprehensive manner but as ten minutes pass the movie starts rolling and in a couple of minute u find yourself rivoted to the seat,all credit to Ranbir Kapoor for his rather Legendary performance,and when Katrina kaif comes....oh she is a beauty in the film...she has rightly been given a role of a Christian for her inability to speak proper Hindi.... Also comes in this great movie package is Salman khan,Upen Patel...and many others....but as i have said earlier this movie is all about Ranbir no one else...he has turned from an amateur in Saawariya to a Pro in this movie....u ll see yourself laughing really bad at certain scenes....and also it has some very good emotional moments.... Add all this what u get is a movie which seems so real yet so unrealistic...barring some fighting scenes where u ll find people flying all around....its a great movie....good enough to watch 2 times without a headache....not a Andaaz apna apna comedy but almost reaching its level at some points....which in itself is pretty Hilarious!!!....surely watch this movie....A MUST!!!" 
" Cute Movie","First, I did not expect much from this movie to be honest. I was pleasantly surprised. Ranbir does a great job playing a guy who is sweet and simple and is love with Kartina Kaif. The film is different because it has no crude jokes and yet it is humorous.The film is set in a sleepy Indian town where Prem (Ranbir) is the president of his failing "Happy Club" , which ends up helping couples in love. He meets Katrina Kaif and falls for her, but he does not know that Katrina already is in love with Upen Patel. He does all he can to help her to marry Upen. Watch the film for the ending.In between there are witty dialogs, very funny scenes, in special a scene where Prem goes dancing with Jenny (Katrina Kaif). Prem already starts dancing to which Jenny says, the dance has not yet started, while Prem replies, "I am not dancing , this is just warm up !" .A real rib tickler, you will watch this for a pleasant time at the theater. It is a surprise at a time when most Bolly comedies are really filled with double meaning jokes and crude humor, Ajab Prem .., does a really nice job to entertain people.The story has its flaws, yet Ranbir manages to pull through and prove he is the biggest rising star in Bollywood. The screenplay was a bit loose but the cinematography was superb. The songs were very well sung and acted.In all a nice movie. My rating 7/10." 
" Predictable, unfunny movie","The movie came hyped but the experience was a big let-down. Leave aside a few good visual scenes and jokes, the overall movie was a disappointment.The good scenes: The bicycle with balloons falling into the lake, Prem's dancing at the wedding.Other than that, the jokes were tired, the characters were one- dimensional with no character or story development. Other than the pre-ordained destiny of the two main characters (Prem and Jenny) there was nothing else to anticipate. When the intermission happened, I was actually wanting the movie to end. The whole story line with Rahul was tacked-on just to extend the length of the movie.Acting wise, the role of Prem was well-acted for a comic role but stammering does not equal emotional acting. The rest of the acting was average.The songs were generally forgettable - I don't remember any of them less than 12 hours after watching the movie."
