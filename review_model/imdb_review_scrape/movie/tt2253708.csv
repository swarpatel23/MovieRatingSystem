" An awesome movie","This is an awesome movie. I like Sonal Sehgal and that is why I watched it. This movie may not be much popular (which it should be) but it's a worth watch. Seems like a budget film but it beats some huge budget films in my opinion. Very good story. Very down to earth. Awesome fun. Seems like this is your story as it doesn't contain all those luxury things which we see in big movies. Just very general things. That is why this feels so us. As many have said this is a cute movie and they are right. It is a story of how a couple went into difficulties by moving to Mumbai from Jammu & Kashmir. They then struggle to live there. You can watch it on YouTube as producers released it for free to watch."
