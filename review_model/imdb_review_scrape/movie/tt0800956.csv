" Mumbai, Actually","Inspired by Love Actually and that genre of storytelling, "Life in a Metro" is a sometimes insightful and sometimes predictable movie that is well worth a watch for its performances. The narrative featuring Kay Kay and Shilpa Shetty is genuine with many insightful comments -Shilpa Shetty's about the "deafening silences in marriages", the interesting question of which between physical or emotional infidelity is worse. Kay Kay's character of being a loving father who is adored by his daughter was a further dose of realism. Nothing is black and white. Special mention to both Kay Kay and Shilpa Shetty (didn't realise she had it in her) for really pulling it off. Shiny Ahuja is adequate without being special.The other narratives were more predictable. Sharman Joshi and Kangana Raut - which is sort of a take off from "The Apartment" with Jack Lemmon and "For Love or Money" with Michael J Fox. So were Dharmendra and Nafisa Ali as the loving elder couple.The track with Konkona Sen and Irfan is very entertaining. Irfan Khan is outstanding - an adjective one has started to use very often with him. Konkona adequate. However the circumstances make for some genuinely funny moments. Konkona as the 30 year old virgin dying to be with her idea man and Irfan - as about the most unlikely of men she could ever see herself with.While I would not go so far as to herald this movie as either a path-breaking or life-altering Hindi movie (as some of the more dramatic leanings have suggested), I would say it is well worth a watch. It has a good music track - but could have done without the really hairy guy singing, as we changed from one narrative to the other." 
" Life in a Metro ...scores high points but....","I've really wanted to see this movie especially because of the ensemble cast that boasts of India's most talented actors (including Irfan Khan, Shilpa Shetty, Konkona Sen Sharma, Kay Kay Menon and Shiny Ahuja). I got a bit hesitant after hearing negative comments but finally decided to give it a go.'Metro' is a cleverly made (for most parts) movie about intertwined lives of people living in the urban city. With first class cinematography the setting of the urban city is fully used. You do get the feel of the city and its chaotic inhabitants who are so busy with their own goals and yet they seem to be missing what they crave most.Let's start with director/writer Anurag Basu. Well, Mr. Basu, this film could have been excellent if it weren't for the following flaws: one of the subplots is sort of a rip-off, some characters required more footage, the background score is intrusive at times and Basu tries too hard to put some 'subtle' messages (e.g. the poster of 'Brokeback Mountain' in Konkona's boss's room). While most of the subplots end well (although predictable), the ending of Shikha's story required better writing. It is because of this flaw that the climax isn't as powerful as it could have been. Through Shikha's decision, Basu's intention was probably to portray her as a strong woman but instead she comes off as a very weak character. However, I have to say that 'Life in a Metro' is a major step forward since his ripoff debut 'Saaya' followed by the atrocious 'Murder'.On the flip side, 'Metro' consists of the best soundtracks of 2007. All the songs have been presented in the background, and they contribute well to the narration. The band appear now and then during each song which is quite a novel concept (but maybe their appearance should have been a more limited).The dialogues are outstanding and very witty, especially those between Shilpa and Kay Kay, Shilpa and Shiny and Konkona and Irfan.The whole Sharman-Kangana-Kay Kay track is pretty much a copy of the classic 'The Apartment' and 'Yes Boss'. However, here it's presented in a darker tone. Then there's a scene where Konkona discovers her boyfriend's sexuality. Now why did Basu give poor Konkona the exact scene from Page 3? The Dharmendra-Nafisa track, though was nice and sweet, at times it seemed a little out of place (except the scene with Dharmendra, Shilpa and Konkona) and forced because it doesn't fit with any of the other subplots. However, this track does somewhat add more to the actions of Shilpa's character. Nonetheless, this track of the elderly couple is still pleasant to watch.The background score, is suitable and effective in parts but at times very intrusive and hinders the effect of the performances by giving it a more melodramatic touch.Coming to the performances, Metro belongs to Irfan Khan, Shilpa Shetty, Konkona Sen Sharma and Kay Kay Menon. Both Konkona and Shilpa's non-verbal expressions speak volumes.Shilpa brings out the depth in her character with such realism that we don't see the Big Brother girl or the woman who was kissed by Richard Gere, but we see a miserable and vulnerable Shikha. We see Shikha as the devoted housewife who yearns the love and affection of her hateful husband, who is so eaten by guilt at the thought of cheating on her indifferent husband that she even asks for his forgiveness (knowing that he's broken every wedding vow). This woman has proved again that she is an excellent actress when given role of substance and thankfully she's avoiding the glamour doll roles which have been overshadowing her acting talent. Her scenes with Shiny, Kay Kay and Konkona are some of the most memorable ones. There's definitely a warm (and sometimes hot) chemistry between her and her co-stars. This is definitely one of her best.Konkona Sen is one actress who has not given anything other than mind-blowing performances. She does an excellent job, taking over a role that was initially offered to Urmila Matondkar. Here, with complete ease, she portrays her character Shruti's transition from the simple naive city girl who is frustrated with her sex-life to the sexy 'outgoing' girl to the modern and somewhat mature girl in love. Her scenes with Irfan are hilarious and equally memorable as the scenes mentioned above. Irfan Khan is equally excellent as is Shiny Ahuja. We see both these characters respectively from Shikha and Shruti's point of view. Irfan makes full use of his limited screen time (but his character very much resembles the one he played in '7.5 Phere'). One would have hoped that Basu gave Shiny's character more footage. His character was one of the most interesting but hardly has more than a few scenes. Yet, he does more than a remarkable.Menon's character is probably the most hateful of all. The actor is a complete natural (though this does remind you a little of the character he played in Silsiilay). However one could argue that his character is a bit one-dimensional except in the scenes with his daughter where we see a loving father. The character needed further development.Joshi is improving with every movie while Ranaut is repeating her Sana Azim damsel in distress from 'Woh Lamhe'. She's adequate but just like Woh Lamhe, here too a more mature actress would have been better suited. In their limited presence, Dharmendra is very likable (thank God, no Amitabh in this one) while Nafisa Ali shines.All in all, this is more than just a watchable flick. It's definitely more than worth a watch among the movies releasing nowadays. What stand out most are the amazing performances. You do take something with you after leaving the theatres." 
" About love, relationships, struggle, metro, and... about life.","Anurag Basu directs Life in a Metro, a fun, dramatic feature which, like such movies as Dil Chahta Hai, attempts to portray the new India. Metro presents several individual stories of mostly young people, and all these stories are intertwined into one movie, which clearly aims to show the real side of the big city of Mumbai with all of its complexities, difficulties and troubled relationships. Each story is presented efficiently, and Basu successfully captures the spirit of the urban city with his range of colourful characters, depicting their modern lifestyle, their trials and tribulations, their dreams, hardships and dilemmas. This depiction is significantly aided by the realistic dialogues and situations, the dark dim atmosphere, the brilliant cinematography, and the narrative style, which is flavoured with wonderful music, great contemporary humour and some breathtakingly shot views of the big city.The film is generally very well developed, though sadly the stories themselves are not particularly original. One story, for one, is an out-and-out copy of the classic gem The Apartment (1960). I was also quite shocked to see that the story of Konkona Sen Sharma, for instance, is given an element similar to the one she had in Page 3 (2005), with one scene being laughably copied from the latter. These, along with other flaws, reduce the movie's quality. Yet, it is still totally watchable and enjoyable. The script gives the film a very authentic feel which, along with some wonderful performances, makes the movie easy to relate to. The film's score is exceptional, and Pritam creates one of the best soundtracks of the year. Songs like "In Dino", "O Meri Jaan", "Rishtey" and "Alvida" are awesome and none of them is actually lip-synced by the actors, which contributes to the film's realism.The acting is generally very good, and some of the performances are excellent. Shilpa Shetty gets a good role and delivers her second-best performance after Phir Milenge. Both films require her to act rather than look sexy and she is so good at it (at both, but I'm referring to the acting here). As Shikha, she is heartfelt and vulnerable and carries her scenes with grace, displaying her character's loneliness and desperation. Shiny Ahuja is convincing as the aspiring actor who falls for Shikha, and their relationship is beautifully portrayed. Kay Kay Menon is very good as Shikha's infidel husband Ranjeet. Kangana Ranaut is a little too loud at points but still effective as Ranjeet's lover Neha, and Sharman Joshi is fine as his ambitious employee who is also in love with Neha. Dharmendra and Nafisa Ali are good in their roles but sadly their story is the least developed and therefore quite forgettable. The finest performances in the movie, along with Shilpa Shetty's one, are unsurprisingly those delivered by Irrfan Khan and Konkona Sen Sharma. Khan is amazingly likable and funny as Monty, and Sen Sharma is more than astonishing as Shikha's frustrated and heartbroken sister Shruti, whose personal problems really bring her down but she later finds the strength to move on. Her character is perhaps the most complex in the movie, as she has to play the supportive sister and friend, the wronged woman, and the woman who finally finds the one but is unsure. Her chemistry with Khan is wonderful with their scenes being some of the film's best and wittiest, and yes, the one in which she breaks down while trying to release her tensions by screaming at the top of her lungs on the roof of a high building with Khan's Monty, ultimately screaming her pain out, is really the film's best acted scene.Life in a Metro is not without its flaws, and the fact that some parts of it lack originality really get on the nerves. That said, it is interesting and has many great moments of moving drama and funny comedy. The film will be mainly remembered in years to come for its rather different portrayal of the big city, its music, and some of its performances, all of which make it an altogether worthy picture." 
" Such a enjoyable film, thumbs up!!!!","I Really enjoyed this film, i think that it is better than the reviews it has been given, all the actors gave great performances , and the story line is superb,this film takes you on a journey of life,love and all its ups and downs that people can go through.I really like how the director has shown the lives of all the characters, and at times he used split screen to do so. I think the film is wonderful how the music is played during the dramatic scenes,with an actual live trio guy band, i think they are famous , but I'm not sure since i am not that educated in Asian films,but i take it they are because they are great!!! the effect is just fantastic, it is a film that has shown much of a creative side that makes you more drawn as you watch.A must see film" 
" Life in a Metro","I heard about this Indian movie's release in Amsterdam, and later knew that it was made by Anurag Basu. I like this Director  who has made a decent mark with his earlier flicks - Murder and Gangster. Apart from that the cast included Shiny Ahuja, Irfan Khan, Kay Kay and Konkona Sen  all of my favorite list of actors and actress.The movie is about several people's lives in Bombay who are linked with each other in some way or the other. It includes a young couple 1) Kay Kay and Shilpa Shetty passing through a terrible marriage crisis, 2) an old couple  Dharmendra and Nafisa Ali who after leading their separate lives meet each other after 30 years, 3) another man and woman  Irfan and Konkana who are seeking life partners, 4) ambitious corporate executives boy and girl  Sharman Joshi and Kangana Ranaut (Gangster fame) who wants to achieve materialistic success through whatever means they can, and finally 5) there is a lonely guy - Shiny Ahuja who meets Shilpa and they fall in love with each other.The movies revolve around these peoples' lives - the key binding link among all of them is a rainbow of love, sex, romance and selfishness.Anurag Basu has himself scripted and written the screenplay of the movie, and because of the tight script each character emerges as real. The whole movie is sprinkled with many moments of emotional range, laughter, smiles and cries. He has handled the characters very well and executed masterly.All the actors have given brilliant performances, but in my preference of rating - Kay Kay, Irfan, Konkana and Shilpa rate the best. Sadly Shiny's role is not long enough to give him the scope for a great performance (the character did have the depth which the Director failed to exploit). A special mention needs to be made of Dharmendra, who pleases us after a long time  with his charm and acting. The most light and best funny moments are given to the pair of Irfan and Konkana. This story line had such a big potential of even making a full length feature film like Chasme Baddoor.There are about six songs in the movie and all of them are sung by male singers. They are composed in special Pritam styles with Sufi touch. I loved the songs and their placements in the movie.I like the light and shades, color and tones used by Anurag Basu in all his movies and in this movie too  he has used great camera angles to capture some beautiful shots of Bombay.Overall a good movie experience.(Stars 7.5 out of 10)" 
" Finally a mature and realistic Hindi film...","After long Hindi cinema has finally taken the jump and started dealing with more in depth emotional subjects. We get intelligent dialogue that looks and comes across naturally. Real issues faced by the modern Indians of today brought to life in this brilliant thought provoking films. that leaves you questioning several aspects of the movie. Shilpa's acting is the best I have seen out of all her movies. Konkona, Kangana, Irfan, Shiny, Kay Kay and Sharman have all acted brilliantly. the scenes between Shilpa and Shiny have been done brilliantly as have the scenes between Dharmendra and Shivani. The film starts of interestingly and engrosses you further, as the story unfolds. the soundtrack lends itself beautifully to the surroundings and you get a sense of a modern vibrant moving city with real people leading real lives (not your usual song and dance sequences around the world) This film portrays a deeper unexplored side of human nature that is very rarely addressed in Hindi films. Brilliantly shot and acted. A must see film." 
" Life in Any City...","They say all's well that ends well. And what if it starts well, runs well and ultimately ends well. Then it's something really good. That's the case with Anurag Basu's Life in a Metro.The film has promising start, with 7-8 different characters being introduced, with Mumbai rains in backdrop. Then a rock band, as drenched as the city, appears from nowhere to churn out a fabulous opening song. You prepare yourself for a good cinematic experience during the song itself. And the best part is the promise is not broken till the end. It's a story of different characters, interwoven together with some link. The narrative is tight and gripping. And that rock band keeps appearing in between, giving soul to the narration. Pritam has done a good job in music department. The film depicts how lives have become in today's fast living cities. People are always in top gear. Chase, rivalry, competition, dreams, compromises, sexual frustrations, exploitation, opportunism, disappointment, love, ecstasy you'll find all emotions in the movie. The film tells the story of people who in search of destination forgot to enjoy the journey, who listen their minds over their hearts. The story is very believable, very true to life. Don't be surprised if you find yourself in one of the characters. Anurag Basu has assembled a line of best performing actors. Kay Kay is impeccable as ever. Shilpa Shetty looks as good as she acts; she's finally getting roles to show her acting prowess and not only those never ending legs. Irfan and Konkana are at equal élan with comedy as they are with intense roles. Sharman Joshi is one actor who seems to fit any bill. Kangna is improving, both her looks and dialog delivery. But best performer remains Anurag Basu. He has handled the script and actors wonderfully to give a very good cinema. A very good effort by the whole team." 
" A realistic approach on life in a metro","This is a good blend of lives of different kinds of people staying in a metro and the conditions and situations they come across. The story is interwoven with different characters related to each other and takes care of all kinds of people not to miss any kind of character that is found in a metro. It is sensitive at times but entertaining. The plot is so nicely woven that you would be in touch with each and every character. The songs are also good and situational. Finally the end being really very crucial and the situations that come up treat everybody in a very practical way to manage everything and you wont feel it unrealistic because the directors and the script writers have done their job....In short, once watchable, worth spending few hours for entertainment. I hope everybody enjoys......" 
" Parallel story lines makes not a magnolia.","Anurag Basu has mastered the art of copying Hollywood movies. He flicks popular Hollywood or world movies/themes and presents them in an Indian context. So in my opinion he is just a smart businessman and not an auteur as he is made out to be. The mainstream media in India is for sale and it's possible to re-paint a cat and call it a Lion. And hence he has a good reputation going for him. Unfortunately due to this hype, people are comparing Anurag Basu to his namesake - Anurag Kashyap - who plays many leagues above him. Other users who like his movies seem to comment based on the entertainment value (some of which should be credited to Mr.Basu as it takes some smarts to be keep his output entertaining) or are totally unaware of the original.I would to distinguish *copying* from *inspiration*. For example, "Dev D" by Anurag Kashyap is inspired by the Novel/movie "Devdas", but it's a thoroughly original take on it. However "Murder" by Basu is almost a scene by scene copy of "Unfailthful" - till the twist-in-the-end gimmick : pretty much like how so many b-movie makers take a hit movie, add a twist but they are pretty much unoriginal. At least most B-movies don't pretend to be original.Similarly, "Life in a metro" is inspired by the Hollywood trend of parallel, nearly disjoint story lines (Magnolia, Playing by Heart (1998) among many others). Here most characters are one dimensional (but that's just my opinion) and unconvincing in their actions. There is no catharsis that a movie of this nature would aim to inflict on the user. In fact at times it seems to go the Madhur Bhandarkar populist way - where by showing something big (a metropolitan city) in a negative light, he tries to win the masses. Yup, so while writing this comment, I found a peer for Anurag Basu - Madhu Bhandarkar. They represent the so called new breed of Bollywood cinema who claim that they'll re-invent the industry. All the will succeed is in re-inventing some beaten story lines. (Okay, Madhur might be slightly more original than Basu but he is uninspiring and populist)." 
" Watch it for Shilpa's powerful performance","Life in aMetro is directed and written by my favorite – Anurag Basu. After having watched Murder and Gangster (and very much impressed with them), I decided to watch Metro. And of all his films, I liked Metro a lot. Anurag is one reason which prompted me to watch it. Second is its taglines: "One City, Countless Emotions: Love, Lust, Passion, Sex, Stress, Romance, Loyalty" and "Shilpa Shetty as never seen before on screen." Metro promises these two eye-catching taglines and lives up to it.Metro is the story of nine different people, living in one city and somehow related to each other. First is Shikha (Shilpa Shetty) who is married to Ranjeet (Kay Kay Menon) and has a six year-old daughter. Ranjeet is in an extra-marital affair with Neha (Kangana Ranaut) who works under him in a BPO. Rahul (Sharman Joshi) is Neha's colleague and he has a wonderful idea for success. He lends his apartment to his bosses to bring their girlfriends, mistresses and prostitutes and in return, they recommend him for promotion. On one such instance, he lends his apartment to Ranjeet and comes to know that Neha, whom he secretly loved, is Ranjeet's mistress.Shikha, fed up of her boring life with Ranjeet, who ignores her, is attracted to Akash (Shiny Ahuja). Shika's sister, Shruti (Konkona Sen Sharma) is a 27 year-old spinster desperate to get married. She initially refuses to marry Monty (Irrfan Khan) but later befriends him. Coincidentally, Neha is Shruti's room-mate. Apart from these, we also have Amol (Dharmendra) and Shivani (Nafisa Ali), the senior couple who unite after their spouses' deaths. Shivani is also Shikha's dance teacher.Tackling multiple stories in 2 hours is a challenge and Aurag does it well except for a few flaws. The screenplay is the best which I have witnessed till date. The lives of nine people are depicted on the screen but the viewer is never confused. There are plenty of songs which slow down the happenings which was very much required. The starting scenes leave tremendous impact on the viewer – Shruti and Monty's first meet, the tense moments between Shikha and Ranjeet on their anniversary, Shruti discovering her boyfriend (Gautam Kappor) to be gay, etc. The post interval portions raise the graph even higher where Rahul and Shruti discover about Neha and Ranjeet's affair, the moment where Shikha and Akash are to get physical and finally, the climax of most of the stories.Anurag handles most of the above sequences very well. The climax of all the stories is very well thought of. Shikha deserts Akash and compromises with Ranjeet for her daughter. Neha dumps Ranjeet and unites with her true love Rahul. Shruti finally finds Monty fit for her. Shivani dies and Amol is left all alone in the huge world. He takes it positively as forty years back, he also had dumped Shivani for his career. All ends well except for Akash and in the end, you really feel sorry for him and Shikha – thanks to their wonderful performances. In the end, Metro does teach us something about human relations.All the actors deliver superb performances. Shilpa Shetty as Shikha delivers her career-best performance. She impressed me in Phir Milenge but that performance is far behind when compared to this one. She shares superb chemistry with Shiny but alas! We can never see them together again. She is superb in the skirts she wore throughout. Shiny gets limited scope but makes use of his screen space well. He is remarkable in the last scene. Kay Kay is excellent. You hate him since the time he appears on the screen. He is under the skin of his character that loves his daughter dearly and uses his workers as hookers. Sharman is good. He doesn't get much to act actually. Kangana gets only one scene where she attempts suicide and she makes good use of it. Konkona is the most likable of all. She really looks desperate to marry. Irrfan Khan's comic timing is good and the way he delivers a serious dialogue with a straight face is superb. Dharmendra and Nafisa don't get to do much here but watching them together is pleasing.Metro has a novel idea; Pritam's (the music director) band is featured in each and every song of the film. In real life too, we have got various bands performing on the streets in a metro cities but it is the first we get to watch this on the screen. The idea is very good, I liked it a lot. Music is by far good and with the mood of the film. Background music is good too. Pritam handles his department well.Cinematography is fabulous. One can see Mumbai in a nutshell in this film. Those who have never been to Mumbai must watch this film. Also, if you observe, the first half of the story takes place in Monsoon while the latter takes place in autumn/summer. Also, the makeup and costumes are good. Shilpa looked stunning throughout.Metro is a great film with a perfect screenplay. Watch it for the story and power-packed performances by all the actors. Watch it for Shilpa as you will never see her again on the screen (at least in this way)." 
" Reclaiming Your Life","Telling parallel stories inter-related to various degrees had been the flavor for some time now in Hindi cinema. Success, however, is almost absent. Anurag Basu had almost pulled it off except for three things - incorrect branding, lack of originality and wannabe rock stars showing up everywhere.The story as such had nothing to do with the city of Mumbai. It could have been set anywhere. Also how the city adds to the plights and joys of the character is not very clear. Rat race, lack of time for family, sexual confusions/frustrations are all a reality today of even mid-range cities, not only metros. This is what I meant by incorrect branding. I think the film should have been promoted as story of the time we live in, irrespective of the city. It would have appealed to a larger audience base.Basu has been liberal in copying the classic 'The Apartment'. You cannot copy a classic just like that. I'm not sure if the makers of 'The Apartment' are at least credited. Originality is the biggest virtue of any art. Then, the rock stars. Pritam and his band were omnipresent throughout the film. The songs are fantastic but they popping up everywhere started to irritate very soon. A more imaginative filming of the songs would have added to the film's value.Inspite of all this, Metro is a very good film to come out in recent times. Though Basu does not go deep into the torments of the characters and just touches them fleetingly, he does manage to capture the essence. Casting is almost precise and all actors do a good job. You get the import of the film that how we are losing ourselves in the maze of the paths laid down for us by everyone except ourselves. It is hard to stand up and reclaim your life. It is difficult to open the car's door and walk out like Kangana does at the end, but probably that's what most of us want to do most of the time." 
" A little over ambitious?","The screening of this Indian film I saw was not the final cut and didn't have the final soundtrack, nor did it feature any background noise. Saying then that this is a review of the film is not 100% correct, but I'll give you an impression of what I did see. Hovering in a genre caught between traditional Bollywood and cinema as we know it in the West, Metro tries to appeal to a wide audience. The trouble is I can imagine it alienating Indian viewers with it's discussion of sex and lust, infidelity and corruption- while repelling western audiences because most of this serious film is laughable. It's not unknown that Bollywood and Hollywood have different ideas about what makes a good film, so at any of the many many points in the film when the three-man band come into shot and start wailing while the foreground displays a montage of characters' situations it becomes ever harder to take the film seriously. So much so that it was excruciating for occupants of the screening room to try to quell our laughter. Shilpa Shetty is this film's most well known actor outside of India, but her acting here doesn't support the fame she found through Celebrity Big Brother, and of the rest of the cast, only Sharman Joshi puts in a notable performance. Anurag Basu certainly doesn't lack ambition (this is the first Indian film to achieve a Leicester Square premier, even if it is on a Tuesday evening while the cinema is being refurbished and without any movie posters) but I have an inkling that the film will be lost on non-Asian audiences." 
" Watch 'The Apartment' instead!","Well. What's life in a Metro all about? Its all about survival; a race to win at any cost and not a morning walk. There are extra-marital affairs, bride and bridegroom hunters, wives who sacrifice their future for family welfare, struggling artists, just to name a few, and the movie provides a taste of these experiences with its star cast..The main essence of the movie is a direct lift from the 1960 classic movie 'The Apartment.' Here a Jack Lemmon gets replaced by Sharman Joshi, and his boss Fred MacMurray is played by Kay Kay Menon. Rest of the sub plots get drowned with regular bollywood masala and never get in sync with the message the movie is trying to deliver.The movie lacks the finesse and treatment of 'The Apartment,' which even today is rated among the best adult comedy made for its time. On this count, Life in a Metro fails miserably since it treats a mature subject with an amateur outlook. At times its difficult to classify the movie as a romance, drama or a screwball comedy. For teasers: How about riding your wedding horse on a crowded Mumbai railway platform where humans cannot get by without a snug fit.Performances by Kay Kay Menon, Sharman Joshi, Irfan Khan, Konkona Sen Sharma stand out, the rest including celebrity big brother star Shilpa Shetty simply fade as the movie progresses. Dharmendra chooses the wrong vehicle to make his comeback, since he waltzes to a role of which he has no inkling. Cant blame him for having that 'lost look,' while playing his part.The movie is relevant to its times and showcases the change in Indian cinema, but the portrayal could have been much better. The soundtrack provides a refreshing change with guitar strings complimenting a few soulful numbers. But after a while, the repeated presence of the singers turns from innovative to frustrating and its better to enjoy the music keeping your eyes shut. The movie might appeal to those who have not seen the original, but for those who wish to watch meaningful cinema  rent a DVD of 'The Apartment,' to watch at home instead." 
" an amalgamation of six stories between nine characters from one suburb","With one movie, Anurag Basu rose quite high in my books as a director to look out for. Gangster was in many ways a complete movie for an Indian Movie audience and one of the best features of last year. Expectantly, Life in a... Metro was highly anticipated, especially with the movie repeating most of Basu cast & crew and a few more welcome actors. Basu sits right on top of the breed of Bhatt-nurtured directors who, if nothing else, have always made movies distinctly different from regular Bollywood fare.Life in a... Metro is an amalgamation of six stories between nine characters from one suburb. These stories entwine and intersect at various points to portray personal lives for regular middle-class suburb dwellers. Passion, Sex, Loyalty, Romance, Lust, Stress and Love become the underlying themes woven into the fabric of the movie.Basu is not in top form here, but this could be more due to constraints of mainstream Bollywood. Visibly a bigger and a more conformist producer like UTV (Ronnie Screwwala) is not as liberal as the Bhatts with Basu. Melodrama and formula somehow creep in and take over the final act of the movie in a complete departure of style from the rest of the movie. Apart from this major gripe, Basu deftly handles interspersing between stories and fleshing out his characters. Adultery becomes a major theme in most of the stories, but moral questions are not raised and neither ignored. Events are simply depicted "as is", letting the viewer judge for him/herself of their moral implications. That extra-marital affairs and sex-for-favors exist is taken as fact rather than implied, taboo'd or endorsed. Rather, the effect of it on individuals is depicted differently and quite aptly. Among the troupe of (mostly) wonderful actors, Kay Kay Menon thunders ahead portraying a selfish and chauvinistic husband and boss. Any scenes with him are the highlights of the movie proving again beyond doubt how wonderful an actor he is, regardless of the character he plays. Yet, for the genuinety of him you are left wanting to see more of him on screen than the limited screen time the director could afford. Complementing him in a parallel story is Irrfan, an equally gifted actor, playing a passionate and philosophical middle-age single guy looking for an ideal wife through matrimonial ads. Sprinkle around them a host of characters to support their stories, and you have a wonderful ensemble that is as true to the setup of the movie as any. Shiny Ahuja and Kanga Ranaut play easy parts but their talents are used only to a minimum. Dharmendra, Nafisa Ali, Sharman Joshi and Konkona Sen Sharma play regulars. Exception: Shilpa Shetty. Her character and performance are so out of this movie that you wonder if she walked into the wrong movie set with a different script. Shamelessly flaunting her star status and new-found celebrity, she proves yet again that being and "Actor" and a "Movie Star" are not mutually inclusive.Basu's association with Pritam continues to produce some really good music. The movie's music is more of a soundtrack with a single musical theme in all the tracks. Basu also has the three-member band appear throughout the movie inbetween and during scenes. These band members are part of the crowd, or drifters singing the tracks that are sprinkled through the movie. A high-end concept for Indian Cinema, and one that works for me completely.Although the climax reaches levels of extreme campyness, it is easy to forgive the director for the battle he fights with only a few others on his side against Bollywood conventionalism. Yet, after the powerful Gangster, Basu's latest is a step down. For his and our sake, I wish him back to the Bhatts.My Rating --> 3.5 of 5" 
" slick, chic and very watchable!!","i just came back after seeing the movie and couldn't help writing something (good) about it. after a series of disappointing Hindi and a few English (spiderman 3)this one was totally refreshing. but as i logged on to the site i saw someone saying that it seemed like a half hearted effort to him.firstly, he seemed to have been too influenced with the sharman joshi n the apartment bit. that was only a small part of the film n not the main story. i agree to his viewpoint that some of these stories did seem familiar and seen before but i would say that they were handled and presented in a much better way in this movie.secondly, most of the Indian directors fail to manage parallel stories like this one but it's been done sensitively here. the movie has it's weak points too, but VERY few. all the characters were well defined, no extra footage to anyone in particular, the story has a few unpredictable sequences and YES the horse on the roads of mumbai was dramatic but haven't we grown up seeing just all of this in most of the other Hindi movies. at least it was done in a more fun way.not to mention that konkona was immense! (does she ever do any bad movies???) irrfan khan was fantastic, shilpa shetty wasn't too bad as well. i really liked gangster and unlike the other first-time-wonder directors, anurag basu does a fantastic job the second time around.it's totally watchable and love irfan n konkona's chemistry!!!" 
" Neither here nor there","The movie does not get into any subject in depth.There could have been more humor because the movie doesn't involve you intellectually nor does it move your heart.I kept waiting for more, just too little and it does disappoint.There was no need to deal with homosexuality(it does not help the story line in anyway). There was no need for dharmender to do such a role (he has lost his voice).Acting is fine. The songs do get monotonous.I wish it was a direct copy of the "Apartment" with some extra comedy. That would have made it a much better movie than what it is now."
