" Shootout at Wadala entertains but is wasted potential","I missed the prequel 'Shootout at Lokhandwala' which did great and after hearing the rave reviews 'Shootout at Wadala' has been getting I decided to give the franchise a shot.I ended up with mixed feelings.What's good? The apropos setting means that as you sit through the first half hour of the movie you will find yourself quickly immersed in the gangster world of Mumbai(then Bombay) in the 70's and 80's.That is courtesy to a gripping story,exhilarating pace and good acting.The actors seem well cast.John Abraham(Manya Surve) impresses but in parts(As always his body is amazing though).It's always good to see Anil Kapoor and Sonu Sood,two of the many underrated actors in Bollywood.What really keeps the movie alive is it's dialogs,witty one liners and crass jokes.The movie justifies it's A rating with lot's of violence and sensuality(not meant for kids).There is a hot Kangana Ranaut and as many as three item songs with probably Sunny Leone's being the best.The camera work and editing are simply brilliant.You would expect a movie with so many positives to be thoroughly satisfying,yet it somehow falls short of that.The movie seems undecided on what it is trying to portray.Is it about the transformation of an innocent student to a merciless gang leader?If so it certainly is n't believable.Is it about the honest duty abiding policemen?It doesn't seem so,then why spend so much time on the lives of the inspectors,an unnecessary digression(Not that i don't like Anil Kapoor,Ronit Roy or Mahesh Manjreker-they are great in their own way).Is it about a face off between John Abraham(Manya Surve) and Sonu Sood(Dilawar Imtiaz Haksar).Well after a great build up,the showdown does n't happen either.Such a missed opportunity.In the end you cant decide whom you are rooting for- Manya,Dilawar or the police.That's where it is a letdown,which is why the ending wont leave you teary eyed or deeply moved. Overall the movie entertains,maybe doesn't disappoint but you feel it could have been much more." 
" An Average Show Not To Be Called A Shootout!","Shootout At Lokhandwala (SAL) was so genuine in both the plot & its character portrayal that it has a cult following. I could say the same for Shootout At Wadala (SAW) had it been short, non-monotonous & authentic.First of all, the makers made a mistake in adapting an already published work. Unlike Hollywood, it hardly works in Bollywood. Secondly, too many characters played spoilsport with the marvelously carved screenplay. Character depth is very shallow, running time is too long, plus the story is clich√©d. And to fill the gaps, they include not 1, not 2 but 3 item numbers to the audience's horror. With a faux pas in non-linear narration, SAW ends without making mark its predecessor was successful in.Abraham is great, Kangana is straight outta her "Gangster" role (plus her accent spoils everything), Manoj Bajpai is terrific, Sonu Sood was sleeping all over the movie while Anil Kapoor is only a man of his words, with certain supporting cast fooling around. Jackie Shroff was wasted. Tusshar is better than he was in SAL.Music is good but repetitive, editing is very well done, cinematography is good & the total feel is in parallel to the genre it is based on. But, since the foundation is rickety with same old story (nice guys-bad guys), SAW doesn't live up to the expectations. The negations are high, especially the lack of clever censorship & punchy dialogues.BOTTOM LINE: SAW is a strict crime movie probably worth a watch which depends on personal interests. Some may like it, some may not.MESSAGE: The illusion that gangsters are born mischievous is wrong.Can be watched with a typical Indian family? NOProfanity: Critical | Sex: Strong | Nudity: Mild | Violence: Infinity | Gore: Very Critical | Alcohol: Strong | Smoking: Mild | Drugs: No | Vulgarity: Strong" 
" An Engaging Action Film!","Inspired from journalist S Hussain Zaidi's non-fiction book Dongri to Dubai, 'Shootout at Wadala', Directed by Sanjay Gupta, is An Engaging Action Film, that re-tells Late Gangster Manya Surve's bloodied story. Gupta handles the film well, while the Screenplay & Performances are note-worthy. 'Shootout at Wadala' is based on the first-ever registered encounter by Mumbai police, where Gangster Manya Surve was shot dead, in Mumbai on 11 January 1982.'Shootout at Wadala' is extremely violent & disturbing. The violence depicted on-screen appears real & horrifying. Of course, the Action-Sequences are rustic & effective, but there is just too much of gore. The Faint-Hearted better stay away! Gupta's Screenplay is note-worthy & is engaging. The first-hour is power-packed, while the second-hour culminates with a nail-biting finale. Gupta's Direction is stylish. He's in form after a long, long time. Cinematography is rustic. Editing could've been sharper. Music by Multiple Music Directors is fair. Performance-Wise: John Abraham as Manya Surve, gives an all-out performance. He's believable all through. Anil Kapoor is simply superb as the tough cop. He stands out! Kangna Ranaut is wonderful, while Tusshar has his moments. Manoj Bajpai is flawless in a relatively small role. Bajpai never disappoints! Sonu Sood is another topper. He enacts an important role with terrific ease. Ronit Roy is excellent. Mahesh Manjrekar is perfect. Sidharth Kapoor holds tremendous potential as an actor. Jackie Shroff shines in a cameo. Raju Kher is brilliant. Priyanka Chopra, Sunny Leone & Sophie sparkle in item numbers. On the whole, 'Shootout at Wadala' re-tells a true story, efficiently." 
" Entertaining and works in most places","I am not a big fan of Shootout At Lokhandwala(2007) even though it was a hit. This time however, the film is directed by Sanjay Gupta and not Apoorva Lakhia which gives this film an extra edge. Yet again filmmakers dig another chapter of a gangster, in this case Manya Surve.When the promos were on air in January or February, I was awaiting this film and the film doesn't really disappoint. The film starts off well and follows the non linear approach which was followed in the original too. The film is set in the period between 1970 and 1982 and care has been taken on several aspects to depict the era. The transformation of John from a good innocent guy to a bad guy is well handled, The war of words is well handled too, The conflicts between John and Manoj and the way John starts his own gang is well handled. There are few unbelievable scenes like the way Raju Kher survives after being burnt through crackers and several more Even there are too many item songs which do drop the pace On the flip side, the action scenes are well handled, another aspect that stands out are the dialogues which soaked in acid and sometimes there are funny too, while some are corny. The film gathers speed towards the end and the end is superb tooDirection by Sanjay Gupta is good, he had shown sparks in derivative films like Kaante, Zinda but this time he has gone original mostly, though half the film is supposedly based on Dongri to Dubai novel. Music is good, but too many item songs slacken the paceAmongst actors John gives his all to the role, he tries very hard and does manage to handle the role well though at times it does come across as too hard. His emotional scenes have improved a lot. Manoj Bajpai in a shorter role executes a strong impact. Sonu Sood is terrific, especially in second half Anil Kapoor has done such roles before, but he adds something extra with his intensity and presence. Kangana in a short role is good, Tusshar is believable surprisingly, he does a good job, providing the film some funny moments though in the second half, he is relegated to the background in between. Mahesh Manjerekar is good but doesn't get much scope, Newfind Siddhanth Kapoor is superb, The actor playing Ranjeet's former bodyguard is good too Ranjeet, Jackie Shroff have cameos, while Raju Kher is good rest are good" 
" great action","The screen writing is watertight. Although it takes time to settle down, the solid writing in the second hour keeps you on the edge. In fact, the turn of events in the second half takes the film to its zenith. A large chunk of SHOOTOUT AT WADALA is devoted to high-voltage action sequences. Unlike some recent films, the action here is raw and real, reminiscent of the films of the 1980s. On the whole, SHOOTOUT AT WADALA is a fire-brand, paisa vasool entertainer. Brutal and electrifying, it is one of those theatre-going experiences that has a plot, is packaged well and has content drama, action, dialogue, songs, performances that works big time with the avid moviegoer. Sanjay Gupta delivers a solid punch!" 
" Cigarettes, Sex, Action and a Ton of Slow Motion - Shootout at Wadala","Shootout at Wadala is just another run-of-the-mill money grab that uses a historic event in the Mumbai crime scene, translating it into an underwhelming "film" or lack there of.John Abraham is cast as Manya Surve, a well-to-do college student who goes by the books and according to him, does nothing wrong. Cast alongside Abraham as his love interest is Kangana Ranaut as Vidya Joshi.The tempo is set early with Abraham being the last hope of his mother to establish himself as an honest man earning an honest living. However, Surve's brother, a gangster, is attacked by local thugs and as Surve pulls one of them off, the brother stabs the bandit and thus Surve is held accountable alongside his brother.After what seems like a brief stay in prison, Surve escapes and begins his life as a new member of the Mumbai underground. Along the way, the story sees Surve undergo a very abrupt and unrealistic development as a character. The so-called nice guy becomes a complete power hungry alpha-male-mentality driven gangster that gets it all and manages to lose it as well. Now, a Bollywood Action-Thriller would not be complete without some songs and a lot of slow-mo. The Item songs are okay, but they add nothing to the plot of the story. In years past, the songs would at least provide some sort of connection to the overall story. But in today's day and age, it's all about having item songs that showcase gorgeous women in skimpy outfits. Not only that, but this film had a lot of awkward sex scenes. Bollywood has long been known as a very conservative film medium and the various innuendo and straight forward sex scenes in this film just made the viewing very awkward, especially the make supposed lust-filled make-out session between Abraham and Renaut. It also seems as though Indian cinema has become very accustomed to using slow motion and bullet time. It would be bearable if it occurred here and there to emphasize intricate fighting scenes. Unfortunately, a large portion of the minutes in this film are used to show John Abraham running shirtless in slow motion, or to showcase every single hit no matter how weak in really slow motion.Overall, Shootout at Wadala is a film that could have been done much better, yet falls way too short in terms of plot and character development and fails to really get anything across beyond fighting, cigarettes, sex and lots and LOTS of unnecessary slow motion." 
" Slick action.. Watch in a single screen to fully enjoy it....!!!!!!!!","I went into the film with the hope of watching a good film because I heard John Abraham say that it was his "best performance" till date and it would be nice if he could win a "National Award" for his acting in this one.To start off with the plot, it is about a college going boy named (Manohar) Manya Surve who, because of situations, becomes a gangster. Anil Kapoor is an honest cop who sticks to his word and is ready to fight evil with brute force. The plot unravels and leads to the first ever encounter in Mumbai Police history.To talk about the positives of this movie, I will have to say that It does manage to engage you on an emotional level. The action scenes shot in slow motion do leave a lasting effect on you. The performances of the lead actors like John Abraham, Anil Kapoor, Tusshar Kapoor, Kangana Ranaut, Manoj Bajpayee, Sonu Sood are worth it. They do manage to hit the right chords.The music is intense and does not slow down the pace of the film. They do add to the intensity and pace of the film. the soundtrack is, mostly filled with Item songs, but does not disappoint.The screenplay is very taught and engaging. The camera-work in this film is really slick. It is very stylish and showing.Now coming to the negatives, The plot, though very appreciable does tend to confuse you a bit. The film does jump back and forth in time and at times, does appear to be strangled. The number of characters also does not help. The characters mentioned above, each of them have an important role to play and therefore, are all important, hence difficult to keep track of.The dialogues are filled with abuses and swear words. It is not the kind of film you want to watch with your family, but with the right friends, it can be enjoyable.On the Whole, SHOOTOUT AT WADALA does live up to what it promises to be. A slick action film showing the underbelly of Mumbai. It is worth watching for the performances and for its slick style. I give it an 8/10" 
" the rise and fall of shootout at wadala","SAW starts up with very good performances and a very good screenplay which takes the movie to the top of a steep mountain but slowly starts to a downfall from the top as the movie reaches its climax and here is my view.PLOT&PERFORMANCES: movie has a very good plot and it is based on true events occurring in Mumbai in early 80's which are been carefully scripted and has been added up with enough spices needed for an Indian screen to attract the masses. The best thing about this movie is about the performances and most importantly of John Abraham where he gave his best performance till date and he receives a great support from all other stars like Tushaar Kapoor, Anil Kapoor, Manoj and Sonu Sood who gave gem of performances. But very important characters that of Manoj and Sonu Sood has been wasted in the end of the movie and if their characters had been utilized well the movie would had been more appealing to multiplex viewers. Kangana once again in a routine character adding up to some adult scenes on screen. The item song by Sunny Leone is good enough but the one by Priyanka doesn't add up to the light.TECHNICAL DEPARTMENTS: the applause goes to the director for his very good casting in the movie and getting out all the talent from the cast out on the screen and also for a excellent screenplay but he adds up erotic scenes which are not needed for a serious life event based movies. Music is not so appealing except for the item song by Sunny and the background score in few areas.ANALYSIS: the movie is really good regarding the plot and the cast performances but the director didn't maintained this inclination in the whole movie which drags the movie towards a downhill towards the climax.The movie is a complete star in single screens but for multiplex it leaves up a question mark." 
" SAW is a must watch for crime buff","First things first. Shootout At Wadala(SAW) has nothing to do with Shootout At Lokhandwala. This is a part of the Shootout trilogy perceived by director Sanjay Gupta. SAW is the portrayal of the first registered police encounter of the Mumbai Police in 1982, a drastic step to stop the menacing Manohar Surve aka Manya Surve. The story is loosely based on Hussain Zaidi's popular novel Dongri to Dubai. Manya is a simpleton who becomes pure evil for his necessary survival. John Abraham plays Manya with extreme character and style. This real life story is worth watching and inspiring gangs. The inclusion of characters based on Dawood Ibrahim take a crime screenplay to a pinnacle. Once again after OUATIM, this film brings out the fact that the Mumbai Police played a pivotal role in Dawood's ascendance to Don.Sanjay Gupta's direction is neat but not the best we have seen in recent times. Although he has managed to extract brilliant performances from everyone. The screenplay by Sanjay Bhatia is almost tight. But the dialogues are explicit. There are some scenes which pack a punch. The music does really nice. The background score keeps you ticking. The songs Aala Re Aala and Laila are awesome. Both Sophie Choudary and Sunny Leone have done a fabulous job. Priyanka's Babli Badmaash is a setback to the flow and brilliance. It does not work at all. Also another serious song was not required. John gives one of his career's best performances. The best thing being that after watching the film you cannot get any other actor who could have played Manya. Anil Kapoor is getting exceptional by every film since Slumdog Millionaire. Manoj Bajpayee maintains his class as always. Sonu Sood is good but has a small part. Kangna Ranuat is fine. Overall, if you discard the two bad songs mentioned above, SAW is a superb watch. It goes better with the Marathi audience for the Mumbai touch. Final word, if you are a crime fan, SAW is a must watch." 
" The making and demise of a gangster","A man takes his beloved to meet his mother, something he has been resisting, and that same girl asks him to intervene when thugs attack his brother. This sets the catalysts for this film, and our hero's downfall.We follow his trials following that unfortunate incident, from prison escape to becoming a notorious gangster and an utterly angry man, driven by vengeance and hatred.Whilst he gains plenty, having lost the link to his family and the girl he once loved he feeds on crime, greed and vengeance. Yet, the audience will not fall out of love with him as we can see through beneath the tough exterior, a hurt young man lies.Police corruption will lend a hand to fate which becomes the vehicle for the abrupt termination of his career, where it was through the same girl that his downfall begun, and with her assistance his demise will be sealed; not by police or rival gangsters who want him dead. A girl that was his classmate, ultimately control all the key cards and stands to be the mightiest of all involved.Decent acting, good visuals, fast paced with enough emotion this is one of the recent Bollywood films that stands out." 
" Blood, Guns, Crime...","SHOOTOUT AT WADALA is a crime/thriller directed by Sanjay Gupta, and starring John Abraham, Tusshar Kapoor, Anil Kapoor, Sonu Sood, Manoj Bajpayee & Kangana Ranaut.The film revolves around the life of Manohar Surve (John Abraham), who was a simple boy, interested in a good education. His brother gets into a fight with a crime lord, and due to his girlfriend's incessant begging, he helps his brother out. However, he didn't do anything although his brother killed him. The police come and take Manohar to prison for life under Section 302, even though he begs them to let him go because he didn't do anything. In prison, he befriends Sheikh Munir (Tusshar Kapoor), where they plan their escape which proves later to be successful, turning Manohar Surve to Manya Surve, on an ambition to become the don of Mumbai. The rest of the film involves Manya, involving himself with crime lords like Dilawar and Zubair Imtiaz Haskar (Sonu Sood and Manoj Bajpayee) as well as ACP Afaaque Bhaagran (Anil Kapoor), an honest cop trying to put an end to all of the crime in Mumbai.Okay, so when I saw the trailer to Shootout at Wadala, I totally wanted to see it. So I booked my ticket for a late night show recently when it came out. The movie was given a strict A rating which I expected. So when the movie started it was pretty normal, but then the gore started. There's stabbing...shooting...killing. It's all pretty much that. And I was alright for it for a while, but then it got a little disturbing. Like, shoving a guy's head into a gola machine. However there are just two scenes like that in the film. This movie is a gang movie, we are supposed to expect that, and well that's the reality, since this movie is based on the real life of Manya Surve, with a few people's names changed like Dilawar Imitiaz Haskar, who was actually Dawood Ibrahim Kaskar in real life. The movie is a little bit disturbing at times but its not a bad film to watch. I feel Sanjay Gupta has directed it EXTREMELY well, considering he managed to make us all see that this is the reality of the case. But even if we cut out the gore, the one thing that also bothered me was the item numbers. Take for example, 'Laila'. Sunny Leone is a pornstar in real life, and they needed a prostitute for the film. They really didn't need to take her. She was extremely unneeded, and her dance moves were extremely vulgar, which really annoying me. The one with Priyanka Chopra, 'Babli Badmaash' was extremely good. It wasn't vulgar, and it was a normal item song, which I appreciated after watching Sunny Leone dance around in her fashion.The acting is EXTREMELY good, considering its start cast. John Abraham actually did really well as Manya Surve. He always has to scream but at times I really felt he was really Manya and I don't think I am going to see him in Desi Boyz the same way next time. He did his role fantastically as a man who was so innocent and how a simple underestimation turned him the wrong way. Anil Kapoor did well as usual. His role as ACP Afaaque Bhaagran was quite a serious one- an honest cop. So in my eyes, he did it well. Manoj Bajpayee and Sonu Sood, always a pleasure. And Tusshar Kapoor actually did well in this one. Kangana Ranaut was pretty unused in this film, however whenever she was on screen, she did her role well.On whole, this movie is a treat. If you want to know the whole story of Manya Surve and the first Mumbai Police encounter, see it. But do not see it if you are feint-hearted- its got a lot of gore, honestly. The movie's not as grand as SHOOTOUT AT LOKHANDWALA, which has no relation to this one, but its an alright time if you are watching this movie for the facts. Don't see it for entertainment, because halfway through the film, you may feel disgusted.So, I'm just going to give this movie a 6/10. It didn't live up to the hype, COMPLETELY, but it did give me some of what I wanted.Make way for "Bombay ka naya baap, MANYA SURVEEE!"" 
" An average movie","Score 5/10 Director Mr. Sanjay Gupta work is good. Movie starts at a very good pace but after that it slows down so many times. It was very difficult to remember the period, which are being shown by supers in date, month, year and place format. So, sometimes it gets difficult to understand the time lapse or connection between the incidents. There are lots of characters, who create confusion. Character also gives jerks at places, i.e. Anil Kapoor is a Police Inspector , who goes to any extent for keeping his promise to a victimized girl,( The girl whose husband got killed by goons in Hotel) then why does he break his promise and even cheats Vidya (Kangana Ranawat)?. It creates inflection in his character. Love track is just OK but it transforms in a lust story somehow at the end. Dialogues by Milap Zavery, are very good but at places it go beyond the character and premises of the film. Performance wise John Abraham and Manoj Bajpai are very impressive. Anil Kapoor and Tussar Kapoor are good. Mahesh Manjrekar wasted. Sonu Sood and Kangana Ranawat are OK. Music, especially " Laila teri le legi.." is very good. Rest tracks are average." 
" SAW is entertaining , exhilarating and stylish. Watch it if you want to know about Mumbai underworld during 80's period","In the early 80's , Mumbai was the hub for underworld gangsters. Each gangsters were vying for blood of other gang members to rule Mumbai underworld. Manya Surve was one of the dreaded gangster who ruled the Mumbai underworld but ultimately was shot down by what is recorded as first encounter killing by Mumbai Police.Based on true story of infamous gangster , Manya Surve (played by John Abraham), Shootout At Wadala is a sequel to Shootout At Lokhandwala and brings you the actual event which took place on 1st November , 1982 where Mumbai Police took the first step to do first encounter killing of Manye Surve in Wadala, Mumbai which shook the entire country.From the director of Kaante and Musafir, Sanjay Gupta brings you the stylish hardcore-action film which is interesting to watch but is saddened by loose screenplay and left you wanting for more. The movie begins with bang depicting the events which changes Manye's life from a bright college student to atrocious urban dacoit. It is the 2nd half which goes haywire and you feel the impact is missing. Direction is good but screenplay is average. Action scenes are superb and stylish and will be a treat for action-movie fan. Cinematography is eye-catching. Special mention for gorgeous set creation representing the 80's era of Mumbai. Dialogues are punching. John Abraham gives his best and comes up with riveting performance. This might be a turning point in his career. Anil Kapoor is as usual dependable. He gives full support to the starcast along with Manoj Bajpai and Sonu Sood. Kangana Raunat looks good but is wasted in a small role.Shootout out Wadala is entertaining , exhilarating and stylish. Watch it if you want to know about Mumbai underworld during 80's period. Good 3/5" 
" Decent Watch","Shootout at Lokhandwala released in 2007 and despite the negative reviews and average response, the film became a hit at the box office. 6 years later, Ekta Kapoor gets Sanjay Gupta to direct Shootout at Wadala. The film has been called a sequel to Shootout at Lokhandwala but both films have no connection. Shootout at Wadala is a more polished film with a better story but it still isn't a great film.The film tells the story of Manohar Arjun Surve a good college student. However, circumstances turn him into a criminal. He gets framed for a murder his brother committed and it is in prison, Manohar losses his naive side and becomes a hardcore criminal. Known to talk big, Manya doesn't get accepted in Dilawar and Zubair's gang because he wasn't speaking politely. From here, the story is how Manya starts his gang and takes revenge against people like that one inspector who arrested him wrongly during his naive days. Manya and his gang of 6 people soon get into the bad books of Dilawar after they murder Zubair. Inspector Baagan is given the order to find and murder Manya Surve in an encounter and that forms the climax of the story.Direction by Sanjay Gupta is good, after directing films like Aatish(1994), Kaante(2004), and Zinda(2006), Gupta gives his best film till date. However, there are still a number of problems with the film. The continuous shift from past to the present in the police jeep isn't effect narration. Certain people will definitely get confused. Another problem is the very first parts of the film. It was good there wasn't too much melodrama but the innocent and naive Manohar isn't shown for enough time. His life just moves fast and eventually he has to go to prison. The first half is slow but it feels fast in the first 20 minutes of the movie. It could've been more effective, but it was still not a major problem. Sunny Leone's item song seems forced but it was needed due to the scenes that happen after it. Other than that, the film is actually satisfying. Most scenes are well handled. Be it the prison scenes or the superb escape scene from prison. Even if Manya's transformation from a innocent and naive student to a ruthless and cold gangster isn't convincing, it is shown in a realistic way. The clashes between Manya and Dilawar are mind blowing, the Anil Kapoor scenes are good as well, the cops are also properly shown in the film.Dialogues are decent, but the use of swear words isn't effective. The constant swearing in Hindi may be comedy and entertainment for some people but others might find it cringe worthy. However, the one liners and the dialogs during the clashes are well built.Action is amazing, despite the hardcore violence in the film, it is solid action people are watching. Another thing to note is that the film doesn't have south style action which has ruined Bollywood nowadays. The film has proper action with no cheesy stunts. Although the murders Dilawar and Zubair commit to are extremely violent. However, those people who got brutally murdered deserve it.John Abraham for once acts really well. Despite his shouting, he does a good job. He delivers the dialogs effectively, his expressions are good. This is definitely his best performance till date. Anil Kapoor is also one of the major highlights of the film. He makes the cops shine out, he also gets some of the best dialogs. The veteran proves he can also do good as a cop. Sonu Sood is good, his clashes with John Abraham is decent. Sonu Sood also acts properly and his expressions are decent. Manoj Bajpayee is decent, although he did better in Special 26. Here he does shine but he gets overshadowed by other actors whose roles have more meat. However, his death scene is good because his expressions make it look realistic. Ronit Roy doesn't have a huge role but he makes good use of his supporting role, he does a brilliant job supporting Anil Kapoor. Mahesh Majrekar doesn't have a meaty role, he gets overshadowed the most by others. Kangna Ranaut has very little to do, but she does good in the climax. Otherwise, her role doesn't give her much scope. Even if she's Manya's girlfriend, she doesn't have much to do. The rest provide decent support.Music is fantastic, Babli Bandmash Hai is catchy and it is pictured well. Laila is also a catchy song but the song picturisation of that one isn't that good. Manya Ala is also a good song, it is pictured well. Dances are also choreographed well.On the whole, Shootout at Wadala is a decent film but it could've been better. However, the film successfully shows gangsters and their lives in the late 70s and early 80s. The narration isn't effective due to the confusion it brings. However, the film is still considered a decent film. I'll go with a 7/10." 
" A fine popcorn movie with song and dance","The prequel to the smash hit, Shootout At Lokhandwala, is based on Hussain S. Zaidi's bestselling investigative book ‚Äì Dongri to Dubai. Adapting a non-fiction book into a film requires special skills because of the need to sieve all the facts presented in the book into the film's narrative and all this while, keeping the film entertaining! This is exactly the reason I was intrigued to watch this film and to see what Sanjay Gupta had done with the subject material. Story: The story is centered around the first Hindu gangster of Mumbai, Manya Surve (John Abraham) and his meteoric rice and his subsequent fall. Tusshar 'the-producer's-brother' Kapoor is Manya's confidante in this journey. Siddhant Kapoor (Shakti Kapoor's son) makes his debut playing a member of Manya's gang and is called Gyanchod! Every gang has an enemy gang. The opponents here are Zubair (Manoj Bajpai) and Dilawar (Sonu Sood). The cops are also a part of the story. Afaque (Anil Kapoor) and his team members do everything they can to tackle crime in the city. And oh, Manya also has a love interest (Kangna Ranaut).Direction and Miscellaneous: Delving into a subject as serious as this and not messing it up must have been the ultimate challenge for Sanjay Gupta. And to a very large extent, he doesn't mess it up. He keeps the proceedings flow freely. The film doesn't sway from its path and is thoroughly enjoyable thanks to the way Gupta deals with the subject. But why 3 item songs, Mr. Gupta? The cinematography by Sameer Arya is one of the high points of the film. Sanjay Gupta has always been known to make stylish film and here again, Shootout at Wadala looks and feels stylish, thanks to Sameer's deft camera-work. What works as a deterrent for the film is its corny dialogues (by Milap Zaveri). The dialogues are stereotypical and there's an astonishingly large smattering of abuses just for the shock value. Being a period film, the production design and costume design is spot on keeping in mind the commercial aspects. Music and Background Score: The item song featuring Babli Badmaash, featuring Priyanka Chopra is a disappointing set-piece with a forgettable tune. Sophie's song doesn't stay with you for too long, either. Laila, starring Sunny Leone is the most fun of all the songs and Sunny looks sizzling in this one. The background score is strictly average. Acting: Yes, as was expected, SAW is John Abraham's best ever performance. And no, it is still not good enough. John gives it his best but the others in this film overshadow him fair and square. Anil Kapoor hams it up like only he can and that's not a bad thing at all! The best act of this film is reserved for Manoj Bajpai who shines as the cunny Zubair. Sonu Sood also makes a huge impression as Dilawar (the role is based on Dawood Ibrahim, of all people). This film could have been made without Tusshar Kapoor and that wouldn't hurt the film at all. Ronit Roy, Mahesh Manjrekar, Siddhant Kapoor do well in their parts. Kangna Ranaut is hardly there in this brawn fest and she does alright. Conclusion and Box Office Potential: If you keep your expectations in check and wish to be entertained, then you will be entertained. If you are put off by abusive dialogues, bad acting and sleazy item songs, then stay far away. This film plays to the masses with cheezy dialogues, quarter dozen item songs and a lot (A LOT!) of action. Barring any major mishappenings, Shootout At Wadala will be a good money churner for Ekta Kapoor. Positives: Stylish treatment and cinematography The entertaining plot The action set-pieces Manoj Bajpai and Sonu Sood The period sets done right Laila Negatives: Cheezy dialogues filled with abuses Poor acting by the main protagonist Babli Badmaash" 
" A film showing how Gangsters are created in India","Based on the true story, the film doesn't favor either Gangster or Police, but leave it on viewers what they take out with them when the movie is over. Once a scholar student(from poor family) with a little ambition to live happily with his mom and going to be wife after graduating, traps into corrupt world of Indian Police and then gets turned into a Gangster and ultimately killed by the same corrupted police. This leaves viewers thinking how system works in India and how talent is turned into crime, and all gangsters out there were really gangsters from the birth? No, many of them are made by our corrupted Indian Police, which still hasn't changed much... I thank you director for making such an eye opening story, but I am sure NOT for our corrupt Indian Police.."
