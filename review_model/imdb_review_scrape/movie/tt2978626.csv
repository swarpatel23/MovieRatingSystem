" It entertains ! Light hearted fun movie. Akshay does well again!","Reviewers look for soft targets like this type of movies to show their 'critics' writing skills. nothing matters if people in theater are laughing, this is what the film intends. Leave the einstein inside you outside the theater, and you will enjoy it.This movie wastes no time to get funny, right from 1st minute. 1st half is simply hilarious. I agree comedy quotient goes down in 2nd half, but drama at end is good. Akshay is good as always. Johny lever, krushna, tamannah all does well too. Music is awesome. specially tera naam doon in opening credits. Johny Johny is excellent.On the whole, it could have been better, but i leave theatre satisfied. Don't miss end credits !!!" 
" It Entertains you thoroughly","The movie doesn't wish to remain subtle anywhere, right from the start it is explicit and out and out. the humour is simple and does not depend on random new age dialogues. What i liked was the directors intent to remain in their own domain of comedy cinema. Some scenes are so funny that you may add them to your all time favourite. The movie doesn't want to address the Hollywood type of humour appetite of many, but remains true to the bollywood style humour that we all have cherished since the last three decades. the performances are brilliant owing to casting of some bollywood stalwarts. Nothing in this movie disappoints me and this was the kind of film that i was looking for since a long time. entertainment is different from the disastrous Humshakals in many ways, humshakals lacked the connect and tried to be new aged while entertainment is all the way a more dramatic and outrageous comedy." 
" Akshay's recent black comedy film after Garam mas ala, Deewane huye paagal and Bhaagam bhaag","It's Entertainment is for all black comedy film lovers and I am sure you wont get disappointed. If anyone says they didn't like this movie, it clearly states that they didn't get this movie and its dialogues. Black comedy is not for all people, only a few get it in right way. Frankly speaking, I didn't like Rowdy rathore as I watched the original Telugu version Vikramarkudu and liked it so much than its remake. Later, though Holiday is a remake of Tamil movie, Akshay did a decent job in it. But when you come to Its entertainment movie, it's totally different in all ways. It really entertains you from start to finish except a few minutes in second half. Dialogues are intelligently penned with good comic timing. Cinematography is really good. Some are comparing this movie with no-brainer Humshakals which I strongly disagree with them. This movie is worth a watch and is the best comedy movie in recent times after Garam mas ala, Deewane huye paagal and Bhaagam bhaag. Akshay's comedy timing is best after a long time. Jonny lever is hilarious in his role of Habibullah. Krishna's dialogues will give you lol moments with his mix of movies characters and its names in his casual conversation. Soonu sood and prakash raj (villians) are like karan-arjun who hugs each other after remembering their late mother's words and in the background, the song played is 'Sooraj Kab Door Gagan Se' from the same film. Dog is well-trained but it would have been better. This movie coveys a strong message to treat animals with love and get back same in return. Turn off your logic minds, sit back and enjoy this hilarious comedy punch film. My rating is 10/10 as a black-comedy film lover." 
" Love your animals because they will give the most ENTERTAINMENT. Akshay at his comic best, a ROARING comedy!!!","Akhil (akshay) is a common man struggling to make ends meet because his father (darshan) is hospitalized. But Akhil is shocked to hear that his real father is the diamond merchant Pannalal (dalip tahil) based in Bangkok. Twist occurs when Pannalal dies and Akhil goes to Bangkok to claim his inheritance. The entire fortune is written on the name of 'Entertainment'- Pannalal's pet dog. What happens from there forms the rest.The director has come up with a whacky storyline and while the presentation was rich, the narrative was great. The dialogues were well written and full of entertainment. The script was okay but the screenplay added amazing energy. The background score was melodious and three songs were worth watching. Cinematography was the main strength to this film. Editing was good. Costumes were well designed to suit the royalty while the art department was majestic. Akshay Kumar delivers yet another cracker with his performance, his comic timing is great, and he proves why he is one of best actor we have today. Tamannah is not just beautiful but has a very seductive appeal in her which is hard to resist. Krishna Abhishek was superb, Johnny Lever was outstanding. Prakash Raj and Sonu Sood have amazing chemistry, and bring the houses with there karan-arjun act. The cameos by other celebrities were effective. The golden retriever Junior named Entertainment in the film is the scene stealer though he proves that every dog has his day.It is not often that one gets to see the man-animal flicks and that too in Indian cinema but this one was a brave and a good attempt. The first half revolves around the elements of comedy, romance and some hilarious moments. Even the interval bang was exciting. The second half gets a bit sentimental but the scenes work and make you moisted eyed.The last thirty minutes picks up and brings back the energy, comedy and ample laughter. Overall, this is a film which is meant for entertainment seeking audience, the film has ample laughter, some emotion, great music, and above all the film has an an amazing dog and great message that love your animals because they give you the best ENTERTAINMENT. A must watch" 
" Review of Entertainment","What makes ENTERTAINMENT attention-grabbing -- besides its distinctive storyline -- is the fact that it is helmed by Sajid-Farhad, who have penned several laughathons in the past. Naturally, one expects their directorial debut to be a rib-tickling entertainer. There's one more reason -- Akshay Kumar. The actor, synonymous with comedies, has a terrific comic timing and with a title like ENTERTAINMENT, the film ought to live up to those lofty expectations, right? Does ENTERTAINMENT hit the right notes? Let's find out! On the whole, ENTERTAINMENT is a joy ride that lives up to its title. Go, laugh out loud and get entertained!" 
" It's Entertainment - Truly! Worth a watch!","It's Entertainment brings together the team of Akshay Kumar, Tamannah Bhatia, Mithun, Johnny Lever, Krishna, Sonu Sood, and Prakash Raj. Each and every actor has done a fine job for their respective roles. The hilarious one liners and effective corny humor manages to make you laugh throughout the movie. There are a few patches where the film does drag, but the first half is full of fun and the later part of the second half picks the film back up. Of them all, it is surely Akshay who stands tall with his wonderful comic timing, with an impeccable ability to make a variety of expressions. This is his comfort zone and he surely excels! Tamannah is there for glamour and surely is pleasant to the eyes. The dog is quite cute and the dog's antics are sure to make kids very happy. The movie is a complete family entertainer. The film's title surely lives up to its name. It promises does of entertainment!" 
" One of the biggest comedy of the year 2014.","AN ENTERTAINMENT: The name is more than enough to explain the title . One of the biggest comedy of the year 2014. Though the movie was not much awaited and even the trailer was not much impressive. Thought that its just another prototype comedy movie but the reality was much better than expectation. There's nothing much to find about inside story but the way the storytelling start is just mind blowing. Entertainment: The Junior Dog: A dog can not only act but can lead the movie. He had a greater entry than a real hero. Akshay: U r the God of Comedy.. U have no replacement and yet you proved once again to the haters. No one can beat your comic timing. Tamannaah: Words are not enough to describe your beauty. U look more beautiful in this movie and the your skills of Saas Bahu serial act was just amazing. Johny Lever: Anyone can die seeing your expression. What a timing and a big salute to the role of Habibullah. True king of Comedy. Prakash Raj and Sonu Sood: You are not only born for the best villain but you can entertain anyone either its a comedy or a serious mafia don. I was literally jumping off my seats to see the expression while Akki was thrilling with the ghost story.Krushna: You are the best supporting cast ever seen and made the sequence more interesting with the silly ideas. Verdict: Its all about the personal judgement. The reviews may be different but if your are a comedy lover, don't have much exception. Just forget your tension at home. I am sure this will be your best weekend treat. The only thing you will get to see is ENTERTAINMENT, ENTERTAINMENT and ENTERTAINMENT.My Rating: 8.5 out of 10." 
" Full Family Entertainer after a long time","I would not tell you the story of the film as it will spoil your excitement for the movie. I shall tell you about Plot, Performance, Direction, Cinematography and Entertaining Value. Plot: Plot is set in Bangkok and is excellent throughout the movie. Performance: Akshay's performance is worth to watch. He is just like as in Housefull 2. Tamannah looks beautiful and id good. Sonu sood is excellent while Prakash Raj is good. Krushna is just average but his one liners are in full swing. Mithun is OK in special appearance. Direction: I did not find any fault is direction. Even they are very talented. Cinematography: Very good Entertaining Value: Watch it with you family. It is the best family entertainer in last 5 years I can guarantee." 
" Entertainment can be a fun ride for you, if you like this genre, this can be absolutely mindless otherwise.","Entertainment, a slapstick comedy by Sajid – Farhad, turns out to be a light entertainer. I could hear people bursting out into laughter inside the theatre and kept on wondering why the movie didn't excite me enough. In spite of my personal dislike for this genre, let me put across my review without any bias. Can't deny the fact that the movie's tone is very light. The titular character of the movie is Entertainment – a dog which was named so since he was the only source of entertainment for his rich-but-lonely master. The title is even justified by one-liners having mention of the Bollywood Personalities, Bollywood Movies' names and Television Serials / Personalities. Digs at various TV shows viz. Teleshopping, Weight Reduction Capsules, Serials with Family Melodrama are also taken. Emotional connect between human beings and pets, the need to take care of the pets, possessing the virtues of the pets viz. loyalty and courage are also projected. Logic, no room for the same in this movie since this is how, it is meant to be – Mindless Entertainment. This is definitely very much unlike the whole slew of comedy films which we have seen in the recent past. You may enjoy watching this movie, if you like comedy movies. The movie begins with Riteish Deshmukh as a host of TV show which is into teleshopping of Jagtap Capsules for miraculous weight reduction and showcases one of the beneficiary as Akhil Lokhande (Akshay Kumar). Akhil is working extra hours / odd jobs viz. dancing, modelling, umpire for local cricket competition etc. and leaves no stones unturned for earning more so as to take care of his ailing father (Darshan Jariwala) who is hospitalized since one year. Jugnoo (Krushna Abhishek), Akhil's friend, runs DVD parlour "Mere Paas CineMAA Hai" and he speaks dialogues with inane cross-references to Bollywood movie names, personalities. Jugnoo is completely filmy. Akhil's romantic interest is soap-opera actress Sakshi (Tamannaah Bhatia). Sakshi's stingy and greedy father (Mithun Chakraborty) challenges Akhil and tells him to earn at least a crore to get Sakshi in his life. Akhil learns that his biological father is Bangkok Diamond King Pannalal Johri (Dalip Tahil), multi-billionaire. The happiness factor hasn't even sinked in that a TV news flashes in regard to Pannalal's death. Akhil flies to Bangkok for funeral and to claim the property. But his dreams get shattered, when he gets further shock from Pannalal's Urdu-spouting Manager Habibullah (Johny Lever) that the whole property has been inherited by Entertainment (Junior - a pet dog). An envious and agonized Akhil decides to stay back and compete with the dog to inherit 3000 crores. Akhil along with Jugnoo employs all sorts of wiles to keep Entertainment, the dog, at bay. They try various methods to annihilate Entertainment viz. electric shock, seduction, chloroform, poison etc. Villainous siblings Karan-Arjun (Prakash Raj and Sonu Sood), Dabbang 1 and Dabbang 2 villains, second cousins of Pannalal also enter the scene so as to claim the property of Pannalal. What happens thereafter ? Does Akhil keeps fighting with the dog or he starts fighting for the dog against Karan-Arjun? How does the drama unfold? Undoubtedly the star of the show is Entertainment, the retriever dog. Akshay has done this in the past as well. Krushna is entertaining in a total filmy style, and is noticeable. Mithun da and Tamannah have less screen time. Johny Lever is good. Prakash Raj and Sonu Sood don't generate hatred rather funny. Dalip Tahil is seen mostly in a framed garlanded portrait. There is a scene, where Entertainment and its canine mates, ranging from Bulldogs, Pugs, Alsatians, German Shepherd etc. show up in great numbers and sit together in a luxurious car is hilarious." 
" A Typical Indian No-Brainer, Watch It For Witty One Liners","This movie comes from the director duo Sajid-Farhad, who have wrote dialogs for the Golmaal series and many other. Acting wise Krishna and Johny Lever make you tickle, rest all are just average. Screenplay, editing and other aspects are bad!! Yes, its a no brainer,but i have given this movie 5 stars because of the dialogs!!! They are hilarious, witty, fabulous etc. The credit for this goes to Sajid-Farhad. They are arguably the most underrated duologue writers!!!Bottom line, it brings out the kid in you, movie leaves you with a message,you can enjoy this movie as a stress buster but besides one liners, its awfully bad!!" 
" A relief for Sajid Khan; Competitor for Humshakals! Very Bad. Avoid.","ENTERTAINMENT: "SIMPLY ZERO ENTERTAINMENT; SAVE YOUR BUCKS" (0.5/5)I just want to keep the review shortest as possible because the heavy headache after watching this outrageously stupid movie ain't stepping out! 1st thing- The trailer was not so bad. Plus, I expected something good from Mr.Kumar in comic genre since his last few outings had been ridiculous (Baring Special 26 & the decent Holiday). But, I am completely blown away. What the hell?, oh no, let me correct; Why the hell he signs movies like this? I have lost my trust on him.The movie is completely trashy. It can compete well with Humshakals and definitely be on top worst movies of Akshay.The Gags (no LOL moment. Even you can't smile properly) are very bad. Even the scenes looked stretched because they bore you down badly. Krushna starts very early in the movie with his one liners and starts in a bearable way but by the end, it gets so much annoying that you just wanna move out of the theater.Just for the sake of reviewing here and at least trying to save your hard earned money, I watched it till the very last song in the credits. Otherwise I had a very strong urge many times to just leave this torturous movie.The music is poor. JOHNNY- JOHNNY too sounded very bad with the flow of the movie. Performances are no doubt worse. Must say, Johnny lever was best of the lot accompanied with the Smart Dog- Junior.I just don't wanna review further. It sucked badly. Also, the movie ain't for family audience. Vulgar and cheap jokes too included. My Friday gone bad.Anyways, Guardians of the Galaxy awaits to be watched tonight.STAY AWAY FROM THIS NON-SENSE ENTERTAINMENT COZ IT NEVER LIVES UP TO IT'S TITLE. (0.5/5)" 
" Animal Lovers will get emotional,others will forget this movie.","Akshay Kumar is in top form after Holiday's Success. Entertainment will add icing on the cake for him. The movie actually doesn't belong to akshay kumar himself. It belongs to all the actors.watch out for one liners.Compared to other masala flicks like bodyguard, once upon a time in mumbai dobara etc.,Entertainment is way way better than all.Its a complete family entertainer with love of a dog as a backdrop. The movie is sure going to be a cult in the coming days because of its novel theme as there is every ingredient of a masala entertainer in it. Its complete no brainer.The reason i am going with 8/10 is because it will leave you entertained. Watch it with your friends or family.Its going to be sure shot fun." 
" A Family Entertainer","'Entertainment' is a light weight and family entertainer. After a long time Bollywood comes with a Entertaining Comedy film. A film that makes you laugh all the time, not even a single moment of boredom.Now Come to the Review,Akshay was great with his comic times, very much liked Krishna's hilarious dialogues (THE DIALOGUES ARE THE HIGHLIGHTS OF THE FILM ACTUALLY) Mithoon was good in his small role, The comic villains of the movie Sonu Sood and Prakash Raj was good too (VERY SURPRISED TO SEE THEM IN COMIC CHARACTERS) Tamannah was OK OK, But the main character I loved very much was 'Entertainment' the heart of the film, a very well trained dog with his cute face surely catch your heart at a glance.Though it's a fun filled comedy movie but it has the tear dropping moments too.I recommend to give it a try, you will surely love it." 
" "It's Entertainment" a Must Watch Comedy",""It's Entertainment", directed by the duo Sajid-Farhad, is a comedy as well as Romantic film. Actor Akshay Kumar along with Tamannah Bhatia has done a good job, providing good fun at frantic pace. Akshay's co-actor, Junior, the Golden Retriever dog, had been a lovely speechless actor in the movie. The music of the film is entertaining as well. Johnny Lever as Habibullah Sheikh is a happening comedian and has played a nice role. Sonu Sood and Prakash Raj have delivered their negative roles in comedian way conforming to the nature of the film. To sum up, "It's Entertainment" will provide good entertainment to the viewers." 
" Sajid-Farhad has done it once again with Entertainment, making a funny, CLEAN FAMILY film with a touching message!","First of all, with performances, Akshay does it again, making a comic role more comic! He is very funny, along with Johnny Lever (or should I say "Habibullah"!) OMG, Johnny Lever blew me away, he was ssssssooooo funny and another amazing performance from him. Krushna was funny as a supporting character. Honourly mentioning Mithun. He has some funny lines which he says hilariously. Some nice cameos from Ritesh Deshmukh, Shreyas Talpade and Remo D'Souza. Sonu and Prakash are funny as the film's antagonist. Basically, everyone was funny and good.I'm impressed by Sajid-Farhad. The directorial debut and it's so good, They're going to direct Housefull 3 next year, ICW (I can't wait)! The good side of Entertainment is it's story is easy to know as the film goes along. Another thing is at times, the script directed the story to a Humshakals-route and make the ending of the film as silly and plot less Humshakals was. But they managed it be aware and take a U- turn and keep away from it all the times it almost happened. But the bad side of that is that some gags were like the Humshakals gags, humorless, stupid and nothing! Fortunately, the rest of the gags, jokes and funny bits attempt to shadow the Humshakals gags and is 85% success.Watch Entertainment, it will 100.0000000000001% change your day!!" 
" very good film","It's Entertainment is for all black comedy film lovers and I am sure you wont get disappointed.
