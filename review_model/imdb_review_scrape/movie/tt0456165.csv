" Enjoyable and visually stunning Bollywood entertainment","Salaam Namaste is one of the lightest and boldest Hindi entertainers in recent years. It is on par with any well-made Hollywood rom-com. The film addresses two very controversial issues in India: live-in relationships and premarital pregnancy, yet does not try to emphasise them or take them too seriously. It is brilliantly shot, with great production values, great cinematography, light and beautiful songs, and well-cast actors. The film is entirely shot in Australia, and the various locations of Melbourne, the sets and the beautiful landscapes are breathtaking and extremely pleasing to the eye. While it is a modern comedy, it never forgets that it is actually a Hindi film, and in the second half becomes loyal to its Bollywood standards. By the same token, while it turns into a dramatic feature, it never forgets to remain modern. The emotions of the film are reserved and not overly cheap. They are natural and consistently flavoured with great comedy.Saif Ali Khan and Preity Zinta are irreplaceable and their chemistry is fantastic. They are sensitive, talented, cool and modern actors who understand this foreign lifestyle. Saif's character is quite unsympathetic, as he is portrayed as someone who does not want to take responsibility for his acts. Yet, he displays the expected transformation into someone who finally understands his mistakes very well. Preity is quite the owner of the film though. Oozing charisma and sex-appeal, she is convincing, charming and awfully attractive as the decisive, moody and lively prankster Ambar. Her vivacity in the first half and her pain and hilarious hysterics in the second are excellently done. There are many memorable scenes in Salaam Namaste. First, the kissing and love scenes between the leading actors are surprising and must be noted. I really liked the "My Dil Goes Hmmm..." song. The scenes when Nick and Ambar fight intensively are funny and well-acted. The scene when they meet at their friends' house and the subsequent "Tu Jahaan" song are moving. The entire birth scene is exciting and funny. But my favourite scene is the "Ben and Jerry's Dark Belgian Chocolate ice cream" one. This is one of the greatest acts of the film, spontaneous and wholly entertaining. I recommend Salaam Namaste to everyone. It's not an extraordinary film, but it's a spectacular and visually stunning romantic comedy for the entire family." 
" Making of a typical Indian romantic comedy.","How they came up with this movie: Aditya: ...But you know it gotta be new.Siddharth: Lets see what we can do? How about a new location?A: Oh yes! In the past movies, We've been to London, new york, LA.. how about Melbourne this time?S: Fantastic! and we can have a couple of beach songs there, you know thats the latest trend these days.A: OK Lets talk about the story. I've an idea, lets do a different kind of romantic movie.S: What different?A: How about if we make a modern day love story, girl and boy both living outside India. That way we can also capture those NRI sentiments you know?S: Whoa whoa. But that we have already seen in so many other movies lately. Need to add something more to it.A: How about if the boy and the girl live together? S: Live-in relationships? Indian audience will never accept that.A: Ha! They are going' to jump on it, it will be a fresh story, wholly new idea, you know. Boy and girl stay together, fall in love, have sex, and then the girl becomes pregnant.S: You are talking about "nine-months"? A: whatever! how many in India have watched nine months? forget it. people are just going to love the idea.S: OK so the story is finalized. What about the music?A: Yeh, we need one or two dance item numbers, one wedding song?S: why a wedding song?A: You don't understand! its that superstition thing!S: OK OK! But how are we going to have dance numbers when the heroine is pregnant?A: Don't worry! Audience won't care. They come only to see the dance and songs. Nobody gives a damn even if she dances while giving birth to her baby.A: I've got this gut feeling, in last movie remember, people loved the comedy. We have to have that in this movie too.S: But its a serious movie. How can it have comedy?A: Then arrange some part time TV actor. You know those anchors, they can speak so much on the spot you don't even need to worry about writing dialogs for them.S: Thats fine. How about the cast?A: Lets see, Preity is hot these day. See if we get dates from Preity, else go for Rani. Male actor, I don't think Shahrukh is that good after Swades. and Aamir, just don't approach him, he'll demand the god-damn script first.S: Then how about Saif.A: He'll do. Anything else?S: We'll see that on the sets. Lets start working on it." 
" Yash Raj do it again!","I thoroughly enjoyed Salaam Namaste, I have seen it many times, and each time, I love it even more.Saif does a perfect job with his role, its flawless. He makes you laugh more than a few times, and he is brilliant. He is one of the few actors that have created a niche with the loverboy role, and can actually pull it off. Preity Zinta does also, an amazing job. She looks fresh, and has updated her sexy status. She still has the same charm she had back with earlier roles, which is fantastic, I love her acting too, its humorous, and great fun to watch.Javed Jaffrey, Abhishek Bachchan, and Jugal Hansraj make up important, but short appearances. I liked the way Abhishek narrated the story, with each introduction of a new character, the story paused and showed their history. It was very clever.Music is enjoyable - it has it all. A slow song, a fast song, a great title track, a cheesy song...The end gets a bit dreary and tries hard to maintains the humour. There are times it works, and times when it doesn't. Easier to understand when you see it.The director has done an excellent job, I must admit, Salaam Namaste is a great film, with few flaws. The script, music, directing, and acting are all fabulous. Siddharth Anand has proved himself in Indian Cinema, and has made a fantastic, very different film.Worth every minute." 
" It is a light comedic Hindi film with a study of "modern " lifestyle","I have just returned from India, on holiday, and discovered that this is a film that just about everybody over there has seen. In fact many people talked about the film because I was from Australia. Because of this I went to see the film with some Indian friends and enjoyed it. It is not the greatest film I have ever seen, but it doesn't pretend to be . It is a fun light comedic Hindi film with a study of "modern" lifestyle. I am looking forward to the Australian release with English subtitles, so I can pick up some things I missed due to my lack of knowledge of Hindi.I am also anticipating finding Ben and Jerry's dark Belgian chocolate ice cream somewhere here. One thing I should advise Indian guys if they come to Australia. You may be surprised to find that most Australian girls are not so fast, and that prostitutes are not found at suburban bus stops." 
" Hindi Romantic Comedy","This Hindi film is said to be a remake of 'Nine Months' and to be derivative of certain Hindi films, but not having seen any of them I am not entitled to comment on that. (I felt an undertone of 'Sleepless in Seattle', not a bad choice to emulate). In 'Salaam Namaste' practically everyone is young and successful and gorgeous, so it is admittedly an escapist fantasy. One could criticize that but on the other hand it's a hard film to dislike. The stars are wonderful together, and Melbourne, Australia, is a major character the way New York often is. Living in Melbourne, the main characters deal with certain issues that they might not face -or would deal with differently- had they stayed in India. Likewise, traditional Indian viewers might find some elements a bit shocking but I don't think the filmmakers set out to put off anyone. Yes, it's manipulative and predictable, but it's a 'feel-good' movie that works. If you can handle a little sugar, I recommend it." 
" probably not original, but enjoyable nonetheless","I'm someone who likes to go into a movie knowing very little about the plot, so when I heard that "Salaam Namaste" was a remake of the American film "nine months" i was not phased in the least bit, especially since i had not yet seen that movie. Yes the movie addresses an off beat issue, but bollywood's attempt to address such an issue should be applauded. It has its shortcomings, just like any bollywood movie does. Preity and Saif have good on screen chemistry. The beginning of the film was a bit slow and trite, in terms of the humor employed, but it was still bearable. The development of the plot and the climax was well handled. The soundtrack had one or two memorable songs, but otherwise it was mostly forgettable. All in all, I feel that "salaam namaste" is a movie worth watching." 
" Really Refreshing!","A really refreshing and superbly made movie for the young genre of audience.The plot revolves around Nikhil "Nick" Arora(Saif Ali Khan) and Amber(Priety Zinta).Nick is the Gen-X cool kinda dude who's a chef at a restaurant and Amber is a medical student funding her fees by working as a Radio-Jockey at the station named "Salaam Namaste".How they fall for each other and start living together is shown quite sensibly without the normal hum-bug and drama.Director Siddharth Anand has put in lot of efforts trying to capture the young mind-sets of Indians living abroad.So Nick and Amber start living together and start a relationship.Everything is fine until Nick and Amber find out that Amber's pregnant.nick wants it aborted and amber insists on keeping it.Fight and mayhem ensues and they break-up.They live under the same roof but avoid and sometimes trouble each other.Finally nick realizes what mistake he's making and woos amber back.Saif Ali Khan is awesome in the movie and proves once more that hes that damn good at acting as he's in his looks.Preity gives a powerful performance and looks ravishing in those small dresses and short hair.Arshad Warsi(Ron) as Nicks Geeky but lovable and cute guy,has performed brilliantly!Tania Zaetaa('Who dares wins' babe) us absolutely forgettable.Javed Jaffery has u in splits and proves hes a force to reckon with when it comes to comic timing!Overall an awesome experience and I do hope u all will catch it.Its a complete entertainer.The music is not that bad.A very enjoyable movie especially with your sweetheart in your arms." 
" Great movie!","I was so surprised by this movie! The only reason why I watched it was because my french teacher was making me watch it. I agreed after a while but I wasn't looking forward to it. I was so surprised at how good this movie was! I didn't want it to finish! It tells the story of a girl and a guy who, when they first talk don't like each other at all, but with time they fall in love and move in together. It is set in Australia and the characters are Indian. The movie, not only has a great story line, but it also shows us a lot about the Indian culture. It has a few songs in it, which are always fun. The movie has it all - i know that's cheesy - but it does! It is a great movie to have fun but it also has some really sad parts when you'll want to grab the tissues. It is amazing how many great movies there are out there but we don't realize it just because they aren't Hollywood. This kind of movie is great to have fun, and it also teaches us a lot about another country's culture. I recommend everyone to watch it, nobody will regret it... the acting is also pretty good, it is harder to tell when you don't understand the language, but it seemed decent. There are very funny lines, and of course the occasional sad part. A great movie that everyone should be able to enjoy!" 
" what's new","Film review: Salaam Namaste: what's new ?Today we have a ready audience who are seeking uncharted territories with films based on diverse themes. In such a scene, a concept of 'live-in" relationship looks promising but when you dig further what you are subjected to is another guys are guys and gals are gals type of Harry meet Sally clone very much on the lines (and influences too) of  Hum Tum, Saathiya, Chalte Chalte, Kal Ho Na Ho et al. Surprising again it is coming from country's No. 1 movie production factory. Debutant writer-director Siddhartha Raj Anand, tried to delve into a mature topic and somehow manages to hold interest till interval with his some witty, smart, one-liners and hilarious situations when the film is still finding its premise. He should be applauded for dealing with topic of sex before marriage without being pretentious. All that took care of metro-based multiplex and NRI audience. Lead characters are very similar to Hum Tum ones and supporting characters' introduction is very KHNH type. All supporting NRI characters are made buffoons. Guys are naughty and irresponsible and Girls are street-smart, today's woman. Oh please, not again. Also, when heroine cries there is a Ganpati idol in the foreground and a Alaap in the background score. Gimme a break ! Do new generation directors require all this ? Post-interval everything goes haywire when director gets into story-telling and tried to deal with too many themes and subplots without doing decent justice to even one of them. Thus you get to see, extra-marital relationship going sour, pregnancy before marriage, women liberation, evolution of fatherhood in hero, numerous forced situations to get couple back together and so many other done to death scenes and dialogs that film follows a very predictable path and ends at same common oft-repeated note. At one point film even goes to the territory of Kya Kehna. Worst of all is the climax based in an operation theater where giving birth situation is made a mockery and sequence is completely dedicated to gallery. Overall film could not rise above mediocre. Though, performances are neat, the subject requires a much younger couple and not the same repeated pair. At least, Preity Zinta should be given some decent pregnancy costumes. Though Javed Jaffrey is a surprise packet keeping audience in splits and so is Arshad Warsi. Except first song, rest all songs are forced. Now, this is for the producers, please pull up your socks before it is too late. Agreed that initial hype, encouraging reviews and record no. of prints gets film terrific openings and it manages to cover itself under "hit" tag yet everyday is not Sunday. Better, watch out !" 
" Good start.. gets a bit of a drag towards ending","Salaam Namaste started off really well. Although the concept of the movie was nothing new (Remember, Chalte Chalte and few others that deal with people in relationships..), I liked seeing Melbourne on the big screen. It makes me want to visit that place. There were certain scenes I thought were really rude and against our Indian culture. The scenes between Javed Jaffrey and his girlfriend. After a while it also got pretty irritating to hear words like "Exactly" and "Sorry" over and over again. The worst part of the movie was the ending. Abhishek Bacchan seemed totally unnecessary in the movie. I wonder what made him chose this role! The ending could have been a little more graceful and all the chaos in the hospital was totally unwanted and rather unpleasing to watch. Saif, Arshad and Tania go a good job. Preity is also good but at times she does get pretty loud in the movie. I would give this movie a 5 out of 10... for acting credentials (except Abhishek) and Melbourne." 
" Coming out of shell!","One of the best movies churned out of Bollywood in recent times. Storyline is very typical of the life of the younger generation Indians living abroad, trying to mix n match the eastern values with western culture. The movie is brilliantly directed and has some very mature performances from Saif Ali Khan and Preitty Zinta.I think it is the first time when the Bollywood movie makers have taken the bold topic of "living in sin"......and have brought to light its pros and cons especially for young Indian minds who have an infatuation of leading a life based on western culture........The movie has lot of serious messages hidden behind a simple theme and mixed with some routine "masaala"........The music is very catchy too! All in all.......a movie not to be missed! *****" 
" We have seen this one before","Salaam Namaste Starring : Saif Ali Khan, Priety Zinta and Arshad Warsi. It has taken nearly nine years for an Indian Director to be "inspired" by Nine Months. What we get then is a Siddharth Anand meets Chris Columbus in a Yash Raj package. So you could meet Hugh Grant (Khan-competent),Julianne Moore (Zinta-dependable), Tom Arnold (Warsi-getting better) and Joan Cusak (Tania Zaetta- getting worse) and Robin Williams (Abhishek Bachchan in one of his most hammiest cameo) or go to Blockbuster and pick up the original instead. Too much hype little spike. I will be posting a more a detailed review on dus-ka-bees.blogspot.com" 
" Re-makes...re-makes & more re-makes","Though a well made movie...with well known & established actors (Saif Ali Khan, Preity Zinta, Arshad Warsi...etc)...good direction... The story of unmarried couples living together is unusual in Hindi cinema, but unfortunately nothing is original about it.This is another Bollywood re-make of a Hollywood movie, and this time it is "Nine Months", a movie which was released (10) years ago in 1995 with Hugh Grant & Julianne Moore.The million dollar question is: why is Bollywood still remaking Hollywood movies which were released over 10 years ago with big budgets, big star-cast...etc? There seems to be a shortfall of creativity amongst directors & story writer in Bollywood. The next question is: why do big stars accept such movies? is it money? easier roles (being copycats)? This is unforgivable I must say to take people for a ride.A good advice for Bollywood's filmmakers...try something original at least." 
" What a rubbish movie!!! How could u Yash raj films? Don't watch this movie!","This movie is disgusting, and yet, tries to be funny.I hated the kissing scenes, and Preity Zinta use to be my favourite actress but not now, after watching this movie!! This movie had no story and failed to get my interest! Yash Raj films are going down. Bunty aur bubily was rubbish and so was Salaam namaste. Neal n nikki was just as bad!The name of the films does not match the story VERY well. The music was quite goot. The music videos were sick. To me, this movie should be a flop! The worse movie i have ever seen! I wish i could give the movie NONE out of ten!" 
" Couldn't you just bet on Bollywood to ruin their own version of ESOTSM?!","Okay guys don't go losing your minds because I just compared this cute piece of crap to one of the best Hollywood films of 2004! The only resemblance that Salaam Namaste shares with Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is that it shows us a side of relationships that we don't usually see in films. And that's where the similarities end. That's the only way it gained 5 stars from me. I liked the way it addressed relationships especially in the 21st century. Somebody needs to send Preity Zinta a memo for her to stop accepting roles in which she portrays desperate women who have to con men to love them! I mean come on! A man doesn't need to have a degree in Neuro-surgery before he realises that he is in love, and Preity, pretty please, stop playing these tired stereotypes of women willing to try and give those men their love degrees! That said, Salaam Namaste is a good looking film about good looking people, living in a good looking country, have good looking jobs and good looking lives, until they meet and fall in love with each other. Then everything is not so good looking any more! Babes, why wasn't Salaam Namaste something original again? Sorry? Exaaaactly! :-D It was mediocre yaar! The out-takes were funnier and more entertaining than the movie!" 
" poor editing and poor concept....A COPY","Well, comparing this movie with romantic comedy like Hum Tum or some other will not be justified This is a very different movie with a very bold story...may be Indian audience is not ready for this. This movie is made with extraordinary outfits which are really imaginary...characters are imaginary too i mean the whole movie was full of CRAP (said 50 times by Saif) ...cmmon Indian film makers...just because Hum Tum was a HIT does not mean you can make us fool.Yes there were positives and Negatives in the movie as they are in all movies...but it went really boring at times...could have been better"
