" I never laughed this much in my life.","I didn't think that they can make this movie better than it's prequel but I was mistaken. This movie is one of the best romantic comedies ever made. Amazingly written,extremely hilarious, it is a total fun ride.The movie is about three guys living together,who fall in love at the same time. And as the title suggests it didn't go so well. The movie depict relationships the most believable and hilarious way possible. The movie isn't slow or boring for even a instance and maintains it's pace for the whole length. The three main characters have great chemistry together which results in some of the most funny moments of the movie.The movie have nice music, good dialogs, well crafted comedy scenes and appreciable acting. If you go to movies for fun and entertainment you will love it. There is no need to watch the prequel if you haven't, the story is not related. Conclusively, It is a must see, as it is enjoyable, witty and a comical flick. It is one of the best comedies of bollywood." 
" Fun watch and completely buck worthy!","After the first part, with a not a completely different cast Luv Ranjan has again made it to the young hearts, especially the males. Pyaar Ka Punchnama 2 is a comedy movie with humorous scenes and dialogue, fast paced and full of 'punch' lines which is surely not a waste at all. Just like the PKP1, this movie too revolves around three male roommates, Sunny Singh Nijjar, Omkar Kapoor and Kartik Aaryan(same cast as PKP1) who fall for three women(same cast as PKP1) at the same time and their life is not the same anymore. A roller coaster fun ride of three men in a relationship, is a must watch for every guy who is or wishes to be in a relationship. Kartik Aaryan's 7 minute long dialogue is awe aspiring, jaw dropping, inspiring and one of the most entertaining part if the movie. Hat's off to Kartik Aaryan's acting. Basically a male centric adult movie, this movie is I repeat, this movie is NOT for all all types of audience, choose your company well to enjoy it the fullest. If you are a fan of the Pyaar Ka Punchnaama 1, you will surely love this more not less and you can't afford to miss this one. Laugh, Whistle, Enjoy!" 
" Basic structure of the movie is same and it's exactly what we wanted. Epic sequel ...Anshul/Gogo 7 min monologue is epic again !!","LoL the majority of average rating is coming from the feminist side i assume :D Well definitely the movie will give you a burst of laughter if you're a male and we were expecting exactly the same, the movie live to the hype of the PKPN1. In beginning i wasn't expecting it to stand any where near to its prequel but i'm glad that i was wrong.Though Thakur couldn't gel up as a replacement for Chaudhary, i personally feel the boys cast should be the same... missed the bonding of Rajjo, Liquid and Chaudhary but Chouka takes that place as a nice replacement package. Its a story that revolves around women's 1. the money minded.. 2. the best friend conscious.. and 3. girl concerned with family... the movie scenes were well shot and Anshul/Gogo monologue is longer, better and epic.I will agree to the fact that First half is more fun and dominant over the second but the story ends really well Talking to their mothers;)Don't listen to any1, if u r a fan of first PKPN you will definitely enjoy this movie without any disappointment, cheers!!" 
" An enjoyable but gender biased comedy that would be LOVED by the boys and (most likely) HATED by the girls for their silly & mean portrayal throughout.","Despite moving on a similar-seen before path, the film still scores well in terms of entertainment basically due to its young realistic feel, local language, enjoyable dialogues and performances specifically written from the point of view of its 3 victim boys projecting the girls as simply mean, ignorant, greedy, money-minded and wicked witches just there to exploit their foolish boyfriends using them to the maximum. So where the boys are truly going to love it, the girls would more likely hate it for their silly, dumb and unpleasant portrayal throughout.Describing the theatre experience, the film right away comes to the point with its 3 male characters speaking their comic dialogues in a typical Delhi-NCR lingo with many annoying beeps. But the young viewers easily get to understand what's being said (behind the beeps) mocking the questionable Censor Board, that insists on muting some key words even in a film given an ADULT rating pointing towards all confusing standards. Introducing the three girls next, PKP2 goes on maintaining the young feel and the well written dialogues, executed superbly on screen do not disappoint at all till it says intermission.In the second half, though the viewers can easily judge that its nothing new from the team progressing on exactly the same format of its prequel, they still don't mind enjoying it as the fun continues in its final hour too, but following a strictly one sided mindset ridiculing the three girls. Moreover it all ends on another high point in the police station sequence wherein once again it's the boy playing the winning stroke insulting the girl for not coming up with the truth in front of her father.In few words there are three basic reasons why PKP2 works majorly for the young boys despite having a stale subject talking about the same things. Firstly, because here we have a completely natural actor Sunny Singh who never lets you miss the most loved character of the original i.e. Liquid (played by Divyendu in PKP1). Secondly it's the realistically written dialogues of the film every boy can easily relate too, making an instant connection with the viewers. And thirdly it's the superbly executed 6.30 minutes long monologue brilliantly performed by Kartik that receives a roaring applause from the audience as if it was their personal feelings expressed by the man on screen so truthfully. In the performance section, I would like to rate Sunny Singh scoring the most (playing Chauka) as it was certainly not an easy task to match up the performance of Liquid in the original and that too with a contrastingly different (and strong) physical appearance not suiting his sheepish character at all. Next is Kartik Aaryan playing almost similar role as in PKP1 but again coming with a fabulous monologue scene deserving all the attention. And then Omkar Kapoor playing it real cool in a pretty decent manner as the main financer of the trio irrespective of an illogically written character constantly being fooled by his greedy girlfriend.Coming to the girls, Ishita Raj scores the maximum (especially due to her belly dance scene), followed by Nushrat Bharucha working hard on her dumb character that at times also turns to be hamming in some specific sequences. Sonalli Sehgall looks hot and beautiful taking a few steps further than the prequel and the supporting cast does a fine job too including Sharat Saxena, Mona Ambegaonkar and the two girls playing Nushrat's (Cheeku's) friends. Technically PKP2 becomes better in art direction, cinematography, editing and background score supporting the theme aptly, but this time its vision as well as the writing becomes more biased supporting the boys in particular.Stating the downers, PKP 2 doesn't offer anything worth mentioning in its soundtrack and one frankly misses a song like "Ban Gaya Kutta" in its various sequences. The basic characterization also turns out to be hugely contradicting when we get to see a supposedly talented and educated person earning 3 lacs a month (Omkar) being fooled so easily by a girl met in a gym, living alone in a big apartment. And then the otherwise confident boy (Kartik) forgetting all his smartness once the girl says 'Yes'.For friends who think the film is once again misogynistic in nature as earlier, it's actually not the same as seen in PKP1 which did have some major features pointing towards the same. As per definition, a misogynist is a person who hates, dislike, mistrusts or mistreats women. Whereas in PKP2 the boys are all loving, trusting and believing in their girls wholeheartedly right till the end and it's the girls only who repeatedly ditch them on purpose either for money, security or being plain dumb like the one portrayed by Nushrat. As a result, the three girls simply get projected as someone highly selfish, intolerable, manipulative and always looking for money or security in their man, instead of love or togetherness. In comparative terms, where PKP1 could easily be called as a fine satire on love and cracking relationships among the youth, PKP2 is a more comical take on the subject conceived specifically from a male point of view as being the key sufferers.Interestingly, sex doesn't become any centre of attraction of the script this time for a change and it's the humour that takes care of every shortcoming of the film providing a fine return of your money and time spent on the multiplex outing.Having said that, though PYAAR KA PUNCHNAMA 2 surely deserves a good rating for its entertainment factor well taken care of, it still remains 'a guilty kind of enjoyment' derived from a one dimensional project sidelining its female characters." 
" An awesome entertainer and slightly better than its prequel","PYAR KA PUNCHNAMA 2 REVIEW- Started expecting high from its trailer release so without any doubts i decided to watch it on first day first show.. Hell yeah what an entertainer. Really i haven't seen its prequel i mean i haven't seen full movie i saw it half or little bit more still i think this one is much better that its prequel. Film starts with a full pace. Does not give you chance to move your attention anywhere from screen. Film entertains you from its beginning till its end. I am 23 years old Boy and Believe me i am writing this review with a smile on my face.. Obviously its an adult comedy entertainer so don't expect quality from it just keep your mind at home go to theater and watch this hilarious ride. Some scenes are just out and out entertaining. 1 scene is there a continues speech on women's behavior from men's point of view that too with continuous full pace from mouth which will force you to clap for that actor. I did it and i don't think i will forget that speech and that scene for next 10 years at least... Acting department has so many pluses which weren't expected for me. I really surprised by all actors performances.. Its totally an urban film i mean almost 50% dialogs are in English so it helped all actors to give correct dialog delivery.. Music is also Good but not very good.. Songs are better to watch than to listen.. Screenplay is damn awesome which entertains everyone with its little bit predictable but still enjoyable twists. It does not have any loo breaks. Climax is not that funny but still its satisfying. Cinematography is very good.. They have shot the film in Delhi and some foreign locations which is treat for eyes to watch on big screen. Director Luv Ranjan throws his impact again. Another successful venture for him.. He had lots of pressure of making a good film anyhow cause people liked its prequel and started expecting much from this one too and he has done it again. So Kudos for him and he deserves it. Final words- If you have dirty mind which can digest adult entertainer with sensible and realistic things happens in relationships then you cant miss this one. Caution- watch it with you Gf/Bf on your own risk. The only msg movie gives is that,'The only woman who understands and knows everything about the Man is MOTHER' and its damn true. Don't waste your time Go watch PKP2 and enjoy 2 hrs from your busy life.. 7/10 stars by me..." 
" Bigger and better than the original !!! Highly recommended","There comes a time in life when you want to break free away from all the tension, stress and depression. In that scenario, movies plays a crucial part in de-stressing and re-energizing your vibe. The sequel to the cult classic 2011's cult classic Pyaar Ka Punchnama, Pyaar Ka Punchnama 2 has right dose of medicine to uplift your mood and entertain you to the core.Pyaar Ka Punchnama 2 tells the stories of 3 room-mates in the city of Delhi and the after-effects in life when they meet their dream- girls.Now when you watch the film, you will notice the premise to be same as original. In fact, the director Luv Ranjan has kind of remade his own film ( Yes, the seven minute famous monologue/rant scene by Karthik Aryan is repeated once again) But the good news is that the sequel is bigger and better the original. Luv Ranjan goes one step further in Pyaar Ka Punchnama 2 and gives you a sensational film. The plot is a simple and predictable battle of the sexes but it is the handling of subject with aplomb and sensational performance with well-written screenplay that will keep glued on to the screen till the end. Luv Ranjan does a fairly good job in keeping you entertained with hilarious dialogues and is sure to bring down the house with hilarious moments in the first half. The second half becomes monotonous with occasional speed bumps in form of unnecessary inclusion of songs and loose screenplay but defined colorful characters with strong presence will compensate for the loose ends. Cinematography is outstanding. Background score gels well with the mood of the film. Editing should have been better. Music is tuneful.Out of 3 main protagonist , Karthik Aryan and Sunny Singh stands out with superb performance. Both of them should be applauded for fine comic-timings. Omkar Kapoor does well as a new comer. Actress did justice to their part.Pyaar Ka Punchnama 2 is a laugh ton which will be remembered for its utmost hilarious moments. Good 3.5/5– Ketan Gupta" 
" A Laugh Riot!","The sequel to the 2011 hit Pyaar Ka Punchnama, 'Pyaar Ka Punchnama 2' is a superb sequel, as this one's A Laugh Riot! Its purely for Men & I must admit, I had a ball! 'Pyaar Ka Punchnama 2' Synopsis: After falling in love, three roommates experience extreme changes in their lives.'Pyaar Ka Punchnama 2' is hilarious, in most parts. Watching the three protagonists struggle in love, is amusing & very, very funny. The characters are well-written & you really feel sorry for the guys. The women (clearly this is a sexiest film) are shown wrong, but again, this is a story about men & their misadventures in love. While the first-hour is entirely funny, the second-hour slows down for a bit, but things get back on track during the finale.Rahul Mody, Tarun Jain & Luv Ranjan's Screenplay is truly humorous. Though one-sided, the Writing still remains engaging & the dialogue, are simply superb. Luv Ranjan's Direction is very good. He has maintained the energetic mood, from start to end. Cinematography is fine. Editing could've been sharper & the film needed some trimming, by at least 15-minutes. Music by Various Artists is decent.Performance-Wise: Sunny Singh makes a terrific debut. The actor shines on-screen & his comic-timing, is spot-on! Omkar Kapoor (a former child actor), also impresses in his adult debut. Kartik Aaryan is quite good, however, his long monologue in the film's latter half on women, is fantastic & brings the house down! Nushrat Bharucha is a hoot. She's consistently annoying & very believable. Sonalli Sehgall is effective. Ishita Sharma looks sexy & delivers seductively. Sharat Saxena stands out in a supporting role.On the whole, 'Pyaar Ka Punchnama 2' works! Go, laugh out loud!" 
" Not Disappointed...Worth watching","Salmon pink, Old rose pink, Carnation pink, Hot pink, Mergenta pink... Seriously I have never imagine that a pink color can be so difficult to understand. But the movie was not that difficult. The trailer was slightly disappointed but movie did not. It works guys. Story line was similar to first part and which has carried up correctly. Movie is full of fun and some emotions. Dialogues are outstanding. Specially the speech given by Kartik Aryan (as Gogo). Yes, I am talking about the speech. They added this time as well with equal humor. You will feel it less if have already heard it in first part. If we talk about cast then I can say that you will not gonna miss Liquid or Chaoudhary. It is not because new guys has replaced them but I will must day that they has created there own space. Now you have Chouka and Thakur to talk about. The guys managed to do handle there roles well. While watching you will not feel like you are watching this again because it is different one.I don't think I need to tell you about the story because it is expected one but the music is good. You can have it in your next parties. The puppy's noise had perfect timing. You gonna love it. Luv Ranjan holds the craze of movie. Movie budget was high as this time as holiday was in Thailand not in Goa. All three relationship stories had there own taste. The awesome thing about this movie is that you can feel the life of characters because it is every next door's story. In the end I will say that it was worth waiting and worth watching. The the taste of Pyar ka Punchnama is in there." 
" Awesomeness","OK this is the first review i have ever done.. Totally worth it .. Reason you ask .. Only if i a, sure the right perspective will not be represented by the votes. A very male centric movie , a side which is barely represented because its a taboo now to speak up as the man being in any state of vulnerability . It is for men what gone girl was for women. Yes a phycho ****** slashing up people sent chills down my spine. Over all a very well constructed movie at a shoe string budget . The perspective about the other gender being exploited has been represent umpteen number of times. I am sure no human bring will deny such couples don't exist . Being from delhi loved it" 
" Every guys life story - Ten on Ten","You remember why millions of us love the TV show FRIENDS from 90's till date the most? Because all of us live our lives through each of the character. PKP2 is the next in succession! This is the story of 90% of us. The 3 guys fall in love with 3 different girls, in 3 different situation and faces 3 different problems, which in reality overlaps in our own lives. It's the wisdom of this movie that counts the most till the end. Until I watched, I was doubtful that part 2 cannot get better than its prequel, but I am happy to say I was so wrong. There wasn't a moment of boredom or a time where the story seemed to get off-track. The direction and the story are beyond perfection, and the cast is the best suited for these roles,even the best of the Bollywood actors/actresses couldn't have done it better. I laughed my wits off till the end. And definitely look forward to PKP3!!!" 
" Watch It For Brilliant Humor And Comic Timing","Pyaar Ka Punchnama 2 is a story about three flatmates/friends whose lives are going perfectly going fine till they fall in love with three girls and since then everything they never ever dreamed of, starts happening. It is a sequel to the movie with the same title released in 2011. The plot is exactly the same as the one in the prequel but the movie doesn't disappoint at all with brilliant dialogs, perfect comic timing.Story and Screenplay (8/10): For some, the story might be shouting out loud - misogynist - and may well be exaggerating the male dilemmas of the relationship. However, there wouldn't be any humor in the movie without that. When the plot and the story doesn't leave much room for creativity, the only thing directors need is an excellent screenplay. And that's what the movie boasts off. While there are some dull patches in between but overall, Luv Ranjan, Rahul Mody and Tarun Jain does a great job with some brilliant punches throughout the movie that the audience will remember after walking out of the cinema hall. The amount of thought and detailing that has gone into the seven minute monologue of Kartik Aaryan is beyond imagination!Acting (7/10): PKP2 doesn't boast of any brilliant acting performances. However, all the newbies do well enough to the demand of their roles and thanks to their good comic timing that covers up for expression flaws. However, if there is one person you will miss in the entire movie, it would be Liquid (Divyendu Sharma) who had created a good fan falling after the first movie. While Omkar Kapoor looks sophisticated enough for the character he plays in the movie, he looks too cool (or may be expressionless) to be frustrated, happy, sad or angry with anything. Sunny Singh Nijjar makes a good attempt to replicate Liquid's level of frustration but misses it by miles. Kartik Aaryan shows some promise in the movie and steals the show with his epic seven minute monologue that tops up his earlier performance. The girls have been given largely similar roles and they respond with largely similar performances. Direction (8/10): Luv Ranjan has impressed with his direction in both the movies. Especially, given the challenge with PKP2, he does well in terms of execution of an already told story. The movie relied heavily on the screenplay, humor quotient and the dialogs and that's where Luv Ranjan directed all his efforts. Climax could have been shorter. For twice or thrice, you feel like its going to get over but it doesn't. With only four songs, he even saved about 15-20 minutes he had wasted in his earlier movie. Overall (8/10): Overall, PKP2 is a great entertainer if you are fine with some adult comedy. The point of view is exaggerated but that's where the fun is." 
" Ridding the Funtastic journey of Love,Money & a lot of Chu**yap-pa","Perfect Ending,Better Dialogue(than previous one),Perfect execution from majority of artist,two actors lag for their respective roles but other actors got that covered up Actually i would give it 9.5 stars for boring songs and acting defaulters. But Kartik Tiwari Got all covered up with his speech and Sunny Nijjar didn't led us down after a Brilliant performance performed as "Liquid" in its prequel.Are Experiencing or affected by love and since "LOVE KILLS" Go get the Pill for this Disease. Fun this weekend,Go Grab your credit and just watch this movie for Love Killing Performances.I assure you are gonna love this ride and each penny will be spend well." 
" Every girl should watch this movie with their guy!","Girls are gonna hate but guys, you are gonna love it! This movie is for all those good guys out there who treat their girl like a princess and end up becoming a victim of their atrocities. I have personally experienced all the kind of girls that have been showed in the movie and I must say that it was a confidence booster making me realise that when all the time, I was made to feel guilty of things I was not responsible for, I was actually right and they are wrong. The fact that there are 10 guys available for any girl out there has given girls the liberty to exploit the guys and use them are "use-and-throw" stuff. Long have they forgotten that guys, no matter how masculine they are have a heart too. This movie is a pat on the back for all those heroes who have survived such girls and a wake up call for all those guys who are being used as resources rather than humans. The acting in the movie is fine but what's powerful is the dialogs and the content. They film makers have portrayed the reality from the point of view of a guy and is a feel good factor for every guy out there who is having a difficult time in his relationship!" 
" Well all girls are not angel. We can be a**holes too!!","Just an FYI :) Loved the movie though !! Tuuuduuuuuu lalalallalalalalalalallalalala
Tuuuduuuuuu lalalallalalalalalalallalalala Tuuuduuuuuu lalalallalalalalalalallalalalaTuuuduuuuuu lalalallalalalalalalallalalalaTuuuduuuuuu lalalallalalalalalalallalalalaTuuuduuuuuu lalalallalalalalalalallalalalaTuuuduuuuuu lalalallalalalalalalallalalalaTuuuduuuuuu lalalallalalalalalalallalalalaTuuuduuuuuu lalalallalalalalalalallalalala" 
" Only funny to male viewers","While the comic effects of the movie were holding up and was enjoyable from time to time, for me the fun was a little marred seeing an image of urban woman portrayed this way. Not going into the debate of which is 'feminism' and which is 'femiNazism', I just don't think a comedy lives up-to its name successfully if it is only funny to a certain gender. The previous reviews have already covered the material of plot and other theatrics. I only wish to say that a comedy movie shouldn't leave its viewer with a bad taste in mouth, as 'Payaar ka Punchnama' did for me. I leave the women this advise, "Watch the movie, but be ready to force a laugh or two, if you don't want to be termed a dirty feminist, and blackballed by the male companionship, who will find this movie highly 'realistic'"." 
" Moms Are The Best. ♦ Grade D+","Moms are the best: That's the moral of story which is obviously similar to its prequel.Three ultra rich bachelors have it easy to woo and subsequently date three hot women, and as they begin their relationships find it hard to cope with the perils. But don't worry, all that happens in these so-called relationships is nothing like what happens in reality. Exaggerated instances of girlfriend pampering, gold digging like it's the end of the world, pretentious party-sex-sex-party brawls are some of the elements that the story uses to create humor. While the first half is periodic and comic, the second is dramatic and overlong.That (all) women who enter a relationship are in for the perks is the main theme of the Punchnama films, and in here, the theme has been remodeled with sexier men and women, plush apartments, Apple products, and mild sexism. Had the narrative added women's viewpoints, I would have rated more generously.Familiar one-liners, anti-climactic second act, and lack of visual sex scenes is what salvages the whole movie from becoming a putrid bore. The jokes are on women, and men's struggle in wooing them; and it is funny to a certain point. If you are not a purely platonic couple and do make love to each other on the kitchen bench, and like to watch (or re-watch) six hot people analyzing stereotypes about modern romance, this one is for you. BOTTOM LINE: Pyaar Ka Punchnaam 2 is a sexier version of Pyaar Ka Punchnama (2011) which believes that it is easier to score in India, and that Moms are the best people to say "I Love You" to.GRADE: D+Can be watched with a typical Indian family? NOProfanity: Medium"
