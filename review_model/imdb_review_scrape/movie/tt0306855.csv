" EXCUSE ME? NANNI.","Well, I came into this film knowing nothing of Baliwood so needless to say, I was quite surprised.  The movie follows the madcap exploits of 2 college guys known as the singular entity, "Chantu-Bantu."  In this three-plus hour long farce, Chantu-Bantu do everything from dressing in drag to sneak into a girls' dorm to tricking a girl to go out with one of their friends by making her believe he's dying of AIDS.Combine a ton of these strange, litte, almost episodic plotlines with a few zany, wildly cheoreographed, music videos, some random action scenes, bright colors, bad clothing, and a little obvious homo-eroticism, and you have an incredibly entertaining film-- that is if you have three-plus hours to kill. I recommend watching it over the course of like 3 days." 
" Style mein rehne ka","This is the story of two friends who are always upto some prank. They keep conning their college mates and peoples everywhere for money. They have got one desire in life. To have a nice lifestyle and a lot of money. The easy way out is to marry someone who has got rich parents and no siblings. They try to patao two girls called Rani and Sheena.To get close to these two girls, they fake themselves to be girls and gets admitted to the hostel where Rani & Sheena stay. But then fake has got something in store for them which is not in their hands. How they are going to help themselves out is the summary of the story.A film by N Chandra, this is a typical Non-Chandra film. Because we are used to see Chandra making meaningful serious movies. But the movie is too good. The case includes mostly newcomers which makes the movie looks fresh."

" Funny but too crude","Sharman Joshi debutted with GODMOTHER(1999) where hardly people noticed him and then he did a cameo in LAJJA(2001) but he became famous after STYLEThe film is a routine college campus fare which leads to a thriller.etcN.Chandra after the disastrous SHIKHARI(2000) tried to make a comedy with new actors There are some funny comedy scenes like the one where they fool Sikandar Kharbanda and also their plans of getting rich and dressing up like girls sadly the gags are too crude in many places The murder mystery is well handled too and the film ends on a good note but the end is too stretchedDirection by N Chandra is decent Music is good especially XCUSE MEAmongst actors Sharman steals the show and displays spontaneity and flair for comedy He overshadows everyone and is one of the main reason to watch the film though now he has come a long way Sahil Khan is too conscious and doesn't match up to Sharman though he has some good funny scenes Riya Sen and the other heroine annoy to hell The vamp is too theatrical Shakti Kapoor is okay Sikandar Kharbanda is funny Vishwajeet Pradhan is funny too"
