" Worth a look","The camera follows the travails of 4 Indo-Canadians back to Bombay as they pursue stardom in the Indian film industry.  Except for the arrogant and pretentious MTV style VJ, Ruby, the kids are all quite likable and you can't help but root for them.  Running time is too short, but anyone who has ever had a dream will enjoy this one." 
" Not much to see here","This is an inconsequential if mildly enjoyable look at a group of Canadian actors who try to relocate to India for Bollywood fame. Their travails are thoroughly predictable and their relative successes and failures unsurprising. Why didn't someone warn these kids that life is a lot harder than it looks in the fan mags and on the movie screens?" 
" Booray for Bollywood",""Bollywood Bound" will show you some East Indian young adult wanabees who want to make it in Bollywood films. You'll see them waiting around, being interviewed, walking and talking, eating a burger....um, not much else. Pretty boring stuff. (C-)" 
" Replace 'actor' with any other occupation, and this becomes a well-done film","This is a very will-done documentary on both basic Indian culture and the culture shock which western visitors experience, but with a twist: the central figures in the story are of direct Indian descent.The problem is, it is designed to be a documentary following the story of actors who wrongly assume that their western citizenship will buy them entry into the largest movie market in the world.  In that regard, it falls a bit short, as do the characters."
