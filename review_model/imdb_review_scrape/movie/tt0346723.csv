" delicious entertainer","After a long time here is a film which entertains,delights and leaves one gasping at the brilliant acting. There are brief tedious patches when Shahrukh Khan and Rani are not on screen but those are few and far between. The story is very everyday -boy meets girl, falls instantly in love and wooes successfully this girl who is bit out of his world. But the Shahrukh charm is such that one wonders how she could have contemplated even for a week the thought of marrying some other chap even if she knew him from childhood. Delightful wooing scenes, lovely songs, very charming and sexy marriage episodes followed by quarrels. These are so believable that the audience is left gasping at the audacity of the rows. Luckily a happy ending and one is left feeling good and satisfied. I shall be very disappointed if SRK does not win every award for this year's best acting. Cant wait to see other Shahrukh films due this year." 
" Can't believe it","I don't know why, but I get the feeling that a lot of the so-called critics mocking the way Hindi movies are done, are thinking it just  isn't right.I for one have come to accept the whole song and dance routine, the sometimes awful acting and outrageous production. (don't expect the song and dance routines to go away anytime soon guys, the companies make just as much money through their sales, as the movie, if not more than the movie takes in!)But credit where credit is due.  As I am writing this post at an early 4:30 on the 8th sept, the intro screen for the Chalte Chalte DVD is on repeat.Having just watched (which always seems to make me apprehensive as to what I might be letting myself in for while I put any Hindi movie on) Chalte Chalte, I was totally blown away!I never thought I was one for Hindi movies (I have a collection of over 400 Hollywood movies) because I believed that they were just silly! but, I have been proved wrong! Shah Rukh Khan is, as usual, fabulous, the story touches on a subject that most Asian families would rather sweep under the mat and put on fake smiles to!But this is exactly what makes Chalte Chalte a cut above the rest movie, and where, in my opinion, is beginning to show how everything within these movies are progressing to higher levels.Rani Mukherji has also put in a great performance as the trying to get blood out of a stone wife of SRK.I would recommend Chalte Chalte to anyone whether you are die hard Hindi fans or not! My perceptions towards Hindi movies have completely changed after watching a string of titles... give it a bit more time, and I'm sure even western movie fans will be singing their praise! :)" 
" Shah Rukh's shining moment!","Chalte Chalte (`Walk Along') is a mainstream Bollywood romance that goes one better. Instead of leaving you at the altar to assume that `they lived happily ever after', Chalte Chalte takes you inside the marriage after Boy meets Girl, Boy wins Girl, to experience Man faces the realities of life with Woman.Start with Raj (Shah Rukh Khan), a middle class guy who owns a small transport company. Raj is messy, impulsive, quick tempered: a guy who acts in haste and repents at leisure. One day he bumps into Priya (Rani Mukerjee), a beautiful, sophisticated upper-class fashion designer born in Greece and raised in luxury. Priya is organized and efficient; passionate, but always proper. Also a bit of a snob, she assumes Raj is merely a truck driver and snubs him accordingly.Love blossoms, but the road to happiness is never smooth in Bollywood: Priya becomes engaged to her childhood friend, Sameer, a wealthy businessman from Priya's world of money and privilege. Raj, not wanting to spend the rest of his life regretting `if only' follows Priya to Greece to convince her that he, not Sameer, is the man of her dreams. Not so amazingly, he manages to succeed.Your typical Bolly romance would be running the end credits about now, but we're just at the interval. The rest of the film switches from sun and sea drenched  beauty of Greece to the mundane colors of Mumbai, and Raj's messy apartment. Now daily life intrudes, and Raj is left trying to keep the grand promises he so easily made when Priya was a prize to be obtained.
Chalte Chalte provides a mature look into a marriage, not of two movie stars, but of  Mr. and Mrs. Anybody. The charm, or the drawback, depending on how you view it, is that the film has no real plot, no villains, no heros. Just real people doing the best they can with what they have, and with whom they've chosen. The problems Raj and Priya face are problems that all married people the world over face every day: disapproving in-laws, money problems, personality clashes, and on and on. The film works best for me on its most mundane level: arguments over wet towels on the bed, shoes on the floor, appointments missed, arguments about anything and everything, and then the making up, the kissing and cooing and apologies before starting another round.Most of the performances in Chalte are solid. The supporting players, including Satish Shah and Lilette Dubay are wonderful, and though a handful of new-comers intrude on the flow of the film from time to time, their presence helps develop the story and provide narration and a bit of comic relief. The usually shrill and obnoxious Johnny Lever shows some welcome restraint this time, and creates an endearingly poignant character who helps tell the story in yet another way.Rani Mukerjee, in my opinion one of India's best actresses, is stunning, both in appearance and in her acting. She exudes a warmth, a naturalness and a realness that makes you want to be her best friend, or her lover. With her exotic amber eyes and husky voice she is spellbinding in all her scenes, an intriguing mixture of sexy sophistication and little girl charm rolled into one.But this movie belongs to Shah Rukh Khan, and no mistake. Coming after the opulent success of Devdas, and the larger than life Asoka, Raj is Everyman, a regular guy with money problems, wife problems, ego problems, problems, problems, problems. Khan is brilliant, and totally believable as a middle class business owner, struggling to keep up with everyday life.  Usually prone to bursts of hammy over-acting, in Chalte Chalte he is restrained and controlled in every scene. Even in those moments when Raj is rampaging over his wife's well-intentioned betrayal, or on his knees humiliating himself in a crowded airport in front of Priya's snooty relatives, begging her not to leave him, Khan never goes over the top in his acting. Gone is the bratty charmer of Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge: this Raj is a mature, sensitive lover, and a bumbling husband, willing in the end to sacrifice even his male Indian pride for his love. Shah Rukh Khan has a definite gift for creating complex characters who don't fall easily into good-guy, bad-guy categories, and Chalte Chalte's Raj is one of those characters. The story has a definite (and intentional) been-there-done-that feel, but Khan is the reason to watch it all one more time.There are those who say the movie has no ending, no resolution, and at first viewing I was one of them. But on second viewing I came away feeling that both Raj and Priya had in fact learned important lessons about each other and themselves. Priya, coming from the upper classes does not at first understand the inner demons Raj has to grapple with, knowing he is from a lower class, and that however successful he might become, to Priya's snobbish Anna Aunty he will never be more than a truck driver. Raj has to learn to put aside his ego if he wishes to remain with Priya, and respect her feelings and attachments, even though they are uncomfortable for him. In the end they both realize that life goes on, you do your best and forgive each other's flaws and mistakes, and love will get you through. Chalte Chalte.The music of Chalte Chalte is a good mix. There are a couple of catchy tunes that will grab you immediately, a couple of ballads that might have to grow on you, and a couple of poignant numbers that I found to be hauntingly evocative during the sadder moments of the film. At times the background score does become a bit loud and intrusive, but on the whole I found it to be quite beautiful. The choreography was nice, if not overly exuberant (perhaps due to Khan's highly publicized back problems), the cinematography is gorgeous, and there are some dialogues and scenes that will stay with you long after the film has ended.There are a couple of scenes that I would have trimmed, most notably the climax which starts out very movingly, but then lags a bit because of length, and the fact that the entire cast are in danger of drowning in glycerine. But Chalte Chalte is a thoughtful offering that will leave you pondering after the closing credits." 
" Beautiful mix of romance and drama","I absolutely adore this movie! I've noticed that films produced by Shah Rukh himself tend to end up in my TOP-10 list -- Asoka, Main Hoon Na. And the same happened with Chalte Chalte -- it's definitely one of my favorites now, right up there with Kuch Kuch Hota Hai and DDLJ, if not better.I really love the SRK--Rani jodi. They both gave great performances and looked really convincing and sweet as a couple. I was so rooting for Raj and Priya to be happy and together in this film that the viewing turned into a very emotional experience for me, which I didn't expect at all, having read some rather lukewarm reviews.Rani looks absolutely stunning (well, as usual) and very feminine. Shah Rukh oozes charm and charisma in a really complex role. I personally just loved his character -- with all his flaws and insecurities. Together they are just way too cute. I liked how realistic and unpretentious this film was, liked the drama in the second half, loved the music and all the songs. They are all outstanding. Overall, I think it was a very well made film that really endeared itself to my heart. Not one boring scene (except for the very beginning -- I really thought that subplot could have been done away with), and Johnny Lever was great -- hilarious in most scenes (in an unusual role), serious and adding to the drama in others.I'm just grateful that this film exists." 
" It Takes Tow to Tangle!","Priya's (Rani Muherjee) performance as a controlling, dominating, "Nit picking" "Neat freak" wife was excellent +! Raj's(Shahrukh Khan)performance as a hard worker, responsible, faithful and romantic husband was Outstanding! Music, songs and dances were beautiful, lively and sexy. They looked like a lovely couple. They loved each other very much and were faithful to each other but it appeared that there were personality conflicts, and family class differences between them because Priya was from a upper class family and Raj was from a middle class family. According to Priya's family, Sameer was the ideal husband for pry, but Priya chose Raj as her husband.Priya's aunt interfered in Priya's and Raj's marriage. She did not approve Priya's new friends whom she had met through Raj. She also did not approve Priya's life style and believed Priya was not leading a life style that her family had dreamed and had hoped for her.Raj was positively proud of his hard work and his accomplishments as a business man. Knowing that how Priya's family felt about him, he felt inferior when he was around Priya's family especially aroungd Aunt Anna and Sameer as Sameer was the person Priya's parents had chosen for her as an ideal husband.Priya did not compliment Raj in a party that was hosted by Sameer although she complimented Sameer. Feeling inferior and insecure, Raj had to ask a waiter about his suit and Watch while Priya was dancing with Sameer.At home, Priya refused to eat dinner after Raj had complimented her cooking. She also refused to hug him after he had brought her flowers and vegetables and had washed the dishes after coming home working all day while Priya was a home maker.Raj ran into financial difficulties with his business. He did not approach his father asking for help. He did not go to her relatives or friends asking for help. Priya did not approach her father for help. She did not go to her relatives and friends either. She went to Smaeer asking for help. He gave her 2.5 million rupees as a favior. Priya falsified to Raj about where she received the funds. When Raj had found out about from whom she got the money from, the hell broke loose. Later, Sameer made it look like only a loan.Although Priya had admitted to Sameer it was wrong for her to accept money from Sameer, she never appolagized to Raj for accepting the money.No one in the world is perfect. There are no perfect marriages in the whole world. Raj took all the blames. He fell on his keens and publicly appoligized to Priya, Aunt Anna and Sameer for every problems in their marriage.Raj is a hard worker, family type of person, he loved Priya very very much and was a faithful husband to her.After considering the type of person Raj is and if some like Raj was to be my husband, I would have eaten my dinner with him. I would have greeted him at the door with a hug or kiss when he had arrived with vegetables and flowers. I would not have nagged him every night about petty things until he had exploded. As a home maker, I would have put away his shoes and would have hung up his jacket after he had returned home from a hard day of work. I would have appoligized for being a nagging wife. I would have apolagized for requesting and accepting money from Sameer because it takes at least two to tangle" 
" Love and conflict in marriage..","I quite like this film. It seems superficially like Saathiya but is also quite different. Shahrukh plays a self made small time transport business owner and is a very down to earth character. He meets a rich high society girl, played by Rani, and falls for her. He "misplaces" her and then after much searching finds her only to be told she is marrying an old friend in Greece. So off to Greece we go and by the end of the trip she is convinced she loves this man - she never did profess to love her childhood friend. They marry and then the story takes us into an inside look at the marriage between two opposites. Sparks fly, fights are followed by reconciliations until there is an irreconcilable misunderstanding over money and a major rift occurs. She goes off to her family, and he is left to pine... There is an inevitable happy ending, but do things resolve themselves as expected? Not really, and this is where I find Chalte Chalte most endearing. It is quite usual to show "reformed" characters, ideal solutions, in Hindi cinema. Chalte Chalte tells us that in relationships one must accept one's partner for what he or she is and not expect that they will magically be altered or reformed to fit our idealized version.I found SRK's portrayal of Raj the transport biz owner very authentic. His romancing Priya (Rani) was sweet and never very over the top - yes I even liked the hokey feel of Gumshuda, and Suno Na Suno Na was divine in sound and picturization. The same old romantic dude? Perhaps, but much more vulnerable and real this time around. I liked his drunk act, his trashing the apartment. The one OTT moment was at the airport. Rani was fabulous as Priya, stunning in looks and in her conflicts with Raj. This movie was when I first felt that she was a serious actress. Taube Tumahre yeh Ishare - that was one sweet love ballad. Lillette Dubey was a little OTT but I like her so that was no big deal.The music was good, and Prem Nagariya reminded me so much of Aisa Des hai mera (Veer Zaara) - but it came before!! Overall - I gave Chalte Chalte an 8 because I liked the story, the music, the acting and most of all the reality that it is hard for human beings to change what is their true nature." 
" a cliche buster in many ways","Chalte Chalte is no doubt a fully fledged Bollywood commercial venture with top stars, exotic foreign locations, expensive sets, colourful dances and melodious songs but at the same time it's a daring experiment in many ways. First of all, the story defies the set rules of development and plot construction: the boy and girl get married very early in the story and seemingly there is no emminent danger to their "living happily ever after" and at a time when you are expecting some external factors to pop up and spoil their happy marriage, the talented writer manages to create an effective and convincing internal conflict to keep the story within its logical confines. Secondly, the flash-back technique is used very intelligently: not merely for the sake of breaking the linear order of events, but to release the desired information in well calculated bits and pieces, inserted at the most appropriate places. Thirdly, the minor characters are so fully developed and so painstakingly dealt with that it reminds you of the great masters of characterisation in the Russian classics. It's a common observation in the Bollywood movies that the hero's friends or the heroine's female friends never match them in personality, performance or screen presence. The reason being two-fold: you can not financially afford to hire a good actor for a minor role and big stars are not available for minor roles anyway. The producer of Chalte Chalte however has manage to tackle this problem very successfully. He has hired a whole bunch of fresh faces...God knows from where?...and made them do exactly what was required. For the first time perhaps the status of a hero's minor friend has risen above an extra boy.Finally I should pay tribute to Johny Leaver, who in his mellow role of a failed lover, has busted his own cliche of a jabbering clown." 
" happy endings don't always happen in real life","What can I say about Chalte Chalte?The cast was excellent as were their portrayal of the individual characters, with Rani shining out the most. She has come a long way from her days in Ghulam, and with her last few performances, she is sure to take the place that Kajol held. She looks classic, acts flawlessly in both emotional and comedic scenes and seems natural. SRK, what is there to say about him hat has not already been said - he is on par with his other performances.
The story is entertaining and patchily scripted with a few flaws and surprises. I have to say that I expected a lot out of this movie, but inevitably it was a concatenation of a other bollywood movies with storylines being nicked from movies such as Saathiya, DDLJ and Hum Tumhare Hai Sanam. Never the less, the songs were good, direction was professional and it was good to see other locations apart from Switzerland.I had to issues with this though: 1 - why did they not use Johnny Lever to his full potential?2 - why is it necessary to have a happy ending? Priyas own words were: even though you love each other it is sometimes not possible for a couple to be together. This is a way of live. With their excellent portrayal of married couple squabbles, it was unjust to say that they would forget everything and go back to being a happy couple? IF they had separated as couples do, it would have being a truly realistic movie and a step for bollywood in acknowledging that all things are not lubby-dubby." 
" Nice Movie","I really liked this movie even if it's true in some scenes we feel bored and I think it could be better done.Yet the songs are really nice. The landscapes also (especially the one in Europe). The story is simple but I think it was the intention of the producer (to produce something which relates the reality).I give 7/10 to this movie especially for the songs and for the landscapes which take us miles away at least during 3 hours so we forget our problems and daily life to enter in the world of 2 "different" kind of lovers which 2 opposite personalities.To watch more than one time because really enjoyable songs, musics and landscapes!" 
" The Challenge - a review of "Chalte Chalte" by a filmi newbie!","Note there are some spoilers in this review.  I have tried to highlight these where applicable.It's not like I hadn't been interested but I still didn't really know what to expect when I was 'challenged' by a friend to go and see for myself why she was so crazy about all things Bollywood.  Ok, so I expected colour and dancing and spectacular music, but what else?  Would I miss the subtleties? Undoubtedly.  But if that were the case, would it still be possible to enjoy the film as an 'outsider'?  Well, I'm here to tell you that indeed you can. Indeed we did!Like I said, I have little to compare the film with in respect of other Bollywood films - not being part of the hindiscenti, so to speak - but let's just say that if the film had ended after its upbeat first hour and a half, its innocence and its charm and some halfway decent marketing would surely have made it a serious - well, in truth, more a cheeky and chirpy - contender for the sort of mantle that has in the past been too easily wrapped around the likes of the entirely average "Bridget Jones' Diary" - that is to say, the "feelgood movie of the year".  Imagine that if you can, a Bollywood film as the mainstream movie hit of the year!  But it could have been so.  Instead, the film continued for another seventy or so minutes, getting progressively darker and deeper.  But don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that I didn't enjoy the rest of the film - I did, it's just that that wasn't what I was describing before.  No, snipping the film at the hour and a half mark would have cost us the brilliantly acted (and scripted) argument scenes.***spoiler*** It would have robbed us of the pathos of the scene where the impressionable young girl accidentally uncovers the fact that all is not rosy in the Raj-Priya home.  But most of all it would have deprived us of the incredibly touching face-off at the airport and the final denouement. ***end spoiler***Overall then, as a first foray into the filmi fraternity, it was an overwhelmingly positive and encouraging experience.  In short, we both loved it.Ok, so my wife had the added attraction of the staggeringly smooth Mr Shah Rukh Khan - about whom my BollyDolly friend regularly, and expansively salivates, but then, truth be told, Rani Mukherjee wasn't exactly lacking in attractive powers either. - a very handsome couple indeed.  But I have to admit that it's Shah Rukh Khan who steals the show.  Hell, this bloke is blessed with a tongue crafted from the purest silver; a charm so potent it should be classified as a weapon of mass destruction and licensed for use against politicians, tabloid journalists, cynics and cold-hearted curmudgeons the world over to make the world a far, far better place. I mean, there was one scene ***spoiler coming...*** where Khan's Raj was telling Mukherjee's Priya all the things he would do for her and how much he wanted her to be happy - all the while flashing that cheeky crease of the face trick - where I think, even a red-blooded male such as myself, would have almost succumbed to marry the royally-larynxed Raj!  He's THAT good! ***end-spoiler***So, as if that's not enough, what else was it that made me love this film? Well, it's the unpretentiousness.  There's an innocence, a simplicity which made it seem fresh.  No tricks. No flashiness.  Just a simple but intriguing story, well told.  Even though at times it seemed to veer wildly between the kitsch and the deadly, deadly serious, and was sometimes hammed up to the extreme, it still left you caring passionately about these characters to an extent that I for one, only usually experience when watching real classics like "Life Is Beautiful". But having already confessed how close I was to succumbing to Raj's charms, I see no reason to feel any shame in admitting that there were nearly tears in my (partner's!!) eyes on not one occasion, but several!It sounds corny I know - though not half as corny as some of the translated song lyrics, man what's that all about! - but this film will make you laugh, it'll make you cry, it'll make you smile and it'll make you grimace.  Sometimes it'll even do it all in the same scene - watch that shoe Raj! I'm still smiling about the beauty and sheer joy of Raj and Priya's trip through the countryside - like a hip "Sound Of Music".  I loved the whole "She's Missing" song (sorry don't know the correct title) and accompanying routine.  Raj's tomfoolery - and although he played the buffoon, when it counted he sure knew how to snare that girl!  Then there's the playfulness of the scenes when they are in Greece together. ***spoiler*** The bit where the girl in the bowling alley bursts into tears; the hilarious scene with the policeman (who played a great role, akin to a Shakespearian fool); Raj's telephone call with an irate customer - how could you NOT love this film? ***end-spoiler*** Then there were the fits of giggles from the blokes in the seats behind us, one even slapping the back of  the seats in front of him, unable as he was to contain his glee at the sheer audacity of the script.I could go on for hours, and I probably will (as someone once said) but why not let "Chalte Chalte" put the joy back in for you?And if the moral of our tale (for although I'm told there often is one, who am I to say) is that the course of true love doesn't always run smoothly but that the rough parts of the trip perhaps serve to make you appreciate the smoother ones even more, then you could say that's just like "Chalte Chalte" and even life itself isn't it?" 
" an example why Rani is the Best in Bollywood","Chalte chalte wasn't a Blockbuster Hit, but more of a Quite big Hit. It is a simple tale of a man who loves a girl about to get married to someone else. The main theme of the film is the second half where after marriage both couple have regular fights which lead to separation. Shahrukh Khan is One of the Best Actors of Bollywood, delivering a amazing role. Rani Mukherjee is the Best Actress of Bollywood. This movie is an example of the kind of superb actress she is. Originally Aishwarya Rai was suppose to play her part, Thank god she didn't. I don't think Aish has good acting skills enough to play a challenging role like Rani has played. Rani has given us Hit Movies with amazing acting in the past. Yuva, Hum Tum, Chori chori and Black are some of her Best work. Rani is a very charming, Beautiful Actress and looking at her interviews, she appears to be very Smart and Confident. I enjoyed this movie very much, Rani looked very sexy in the song Tauba. Recommended to all viewers." 
" good movie...but bad direction","***** SPOILER******   SPOILER********  SPOILER*******BEWARE****SPOILER***Sharukh Khan and Rani Mukerjee are both my favorite actors, I would recommend you to watch this movie. But the direction of this movie is really bad, it could have been better. I am pointing out some mistakes.The story starts when Raj (Sharukh) and Priya (Rani) meet with a freak accident. Raj invites Priya to accompany her from Mahabaleshwar to Mumbai. They start their journey when Raj acts totally 'dehati' (someone from a village); this should have been done if required after some time of their travel. Then the traffic police sequence was good and subsequent sequences were nice until Raj meets Priya in Mumbai and tells her he looking for her for 20 days , this is way too impractical , how can he obstruct traffic for so much time. Then he follows Priya to Greece for her engagement. In the Plane when it was announced that flight would be delayed, Raj's excitement came after a moment, it should have come instantaneously. The car ride from Macanese to Athens should have been prolonged, and it should not be 10-12 hours drive but around 20-24 hours drive, any truck driver can drive 10-12 hours easily. When they were married, their love should have been shown a little more, not petty fights all the time. Another blunder in the direction was when Raj tries to stop Priya from going back to Athens; this scene was more of a comedy than an emotional scene. The biggest mistake was, to end the film with a directional error, here when Raj enters his house and takes off his shoes, he hears a voice of Priya telling him not to do so, but it should have been when he drops his shoes he should have remembered Priya and then place his hoes properly in its place, then they should have met with love.I would rate this film 5 on a scale of 10." 
" One simple word, BRILLIANT!!!!!","I loved this movie, from start to finish, the songs amazing (perhaps not the Sonu Nigam one) the performance of each and every one of the cast, flawless.Let's start with King Khan, I loved the way he looked at Rani with affection the first time he saw her, it looked genuine and not some feature that was plastered on his face. The way their relationship developed, was touching and for the first time I didn't cringe after the fact that the hero run's off to woo his love before she gets married to someone else. In Every scene, he looked cool and fresh in his pale browns and muddy jeans, which was a change from most of the outrageous yellow shirt that they wear with an awful orange jacket.Rani was beautiful throughout the movie, she wore clothes that had made me realise that my wardrobe needed updating, her makeup, did she even wear any? It looked subtle and not too over the top. Her performance was outstanding, heart-warming, I loved her every scenes, it made me want to fast forward the next scenes until she was on screen (thank god for me and my DVD player she was on the screen as much as Shahrukh) The whole movie was a great achievement and I was glad to see that the film didn't end with a big happy ending it ended with what was building a crack in their marriage, an argument.I'm glad I purchased the film on DVD, as well as its soundtrack, it was one of my few but best buys!" 
" Good film...","To provide the other perspective on the film, it was still a hit. Probably the 1st good hit of Dreamz Unlimited, but definitely not Aziz Mirza's first with Shah Rukh Khan. The film is  a feel-good film, that tried to tackle the usual problems of married life, but in a light manner. Yes, at the end of it, you kind of feel cheated, because you feel the problems have not been addressed properly, let alone been solved in the story, but you also leave with the feeling that you've laughed at the stupid jokes for the last 2-3 hrs... You remember Shah Rukh stupidly trying to persuade Rani to accept him, or stupidly trying to butter her up when she is angry after the wedding. And most of all, it's appealing because, as SRK himself says, it's him a role that's not larger than life. It's not superhuman Devdas or Asoka. It's stupid Shah Rukh as we've seen him in down-to-earth films like Raju Ban gaga gentleman, Yes Boss, or even Dilwale dulhanya, kuch kuch, and dil to pagal. It's a character that could be us..." 
" An A-class family drama......","A lot has been said about the story line and stuff. I will confine myself to a few comments only: 1. Audiences go to the cinema hall for entertainment and any film that could hold them for 3 hrs is bound to be a hit. The one which has moments that could grip you in between does average business and rest are flops. Chalte Chalte with its music, acting, frames, screen play is one such film that grips you during the three hours of viewing and has all the ingredients of being a hit. 2. Shahrukh Khan once again shows why he rules Bollywood. Taking a wafer-thin plot all on his own to convert it into an Ace speaks volumes about the actors class. Anybody anywhere in hindi/urdu speaking communities can correlate himself to his role. After larger than life roles (and that too hits), the actor has managed to come up with a light film in a style and has shown why he is distinct in the best actor hall of Indian cinema. 3. This film might be the turning point of Rani Mukherjee's career and Aishwaria Rai might consider unlucky losing this film. 4. Aziz Mirza deserves full marks for keeping the story simple and executing it with style. 5. "Prem Nagarya" number reminds one of the 80's Yash Chopra or early 90's Rakesh Roshan numbers and is refreshing. 6. Chalte Chalte once again proves the fact that if a film is made keeping in view what audience wants, it will be a hit. Else, how could a film with a repeated theme, usual story line could be a hit." 
" Great Movie....after a very long time!","After hearing that this movie is similar to 'Saathiya' i never had much expectations from it...also the promos never helped! However, after watching it, i was quite pleased with the film. Especially after the boring movies that are coming out lately! It was a similar story to 'saathiya' but it was treated in a completely different way. I thought the husband-wife arguments were more realistic in this movie than saathiya. The story really flowed well and the scene where Shahrukh drops Rani off to her home in Greece is a classic. It is so romantic and emotional. Overall i think the performances were excellent. Shahrukh khan really stole the show and he proved with this movie why he is no.1 The film is really worth watching and i assure you that you will not be dissapointed."
