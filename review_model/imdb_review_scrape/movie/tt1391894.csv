" Interesting debut film with a message","Siddharth The Prisoner holds the audience's interest even though it has a clich√©d story line with a briefcase mix up et al. Debutant director Pryas Gupta has relied on some slick camera-work and a fresh cast to indicate why the teachings of the ancient scriptures are still apt for modern times. It was interesting to note that a majority of the film, and the lead role primarily, were bereft of dialogues. In a way this action prepared itself for the climax and as such also made the movie less suspenseful. Delivering the message to the audience was given preference over explaining some situations. On an overall basis Siddharth proves to be an interesting debut film, and the audience can expect to receive more from the upcoming director with greater curiosity. 6/10."
