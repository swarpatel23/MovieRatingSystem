" Best comedy delivered yet.............","I have seen movie this yesterday....blown away by the comedy from every actor in the movie (yep Ajay....... too). I seems to me that bollywood have found the pulse of audience, they want to laugh and this movie certainly delivered.......Story is very typical four usual young/handsome, doing some con and end up in funny situations all the way.......Since matrix it most of action now done with multiple cameras and strings (actually in hong Kong movies doing for years.....) a lot of use of green screen, editing was excellent, couple of times felt wires/strings shows when they lift Ajey........Paresh is as usual good/funny, highly recommended for family, couple of "beeps" dialog's were original, references from movie black gave a good touch....... songs were awful.......I have given 9 out of 10 cause of fun and originality........" 
" Good comedy - at last!","After a string of pathetic comedy films in 2006 (Tom,Dick and Harry , Malamaal Weekly, ChupChupke, Pyare-Mohan, etc.), Golmaal comes as a pleasant surprise. Golmaal is essentially a laughter riot, driven by an outrageous but rib-tickling plot. Howver, it is not the storyline that clinches it for the film - it is the amazing chemistry that the four male lead actors (Devgan, Kapoor, Warsi and Sharman Joshi) share that gives the film the requisite 'kick'. The film naturally has its share of flaws - negligible part of heroine, wastage of a stalwart like Paresh Rawal, a damp ending, but all in all, the film is a humorous treat.Ajay Devgan discovers new acting horizons with this role, while Arshad Warsi and Sharman Joshi cement their identities as comedy-specialists. In the end you just hope that the director has showed a better casting acumen by casting someone other than the hapless Tusshar Kapoor (needs to revisit the acting school) , as the mute prankster.Vishal-Shekhar's music is trendy . Watch out for the the black-n-white track featuring Paresh Rawal and his on-screen wife that has a 1940's feel to it." 
" The best part in the whole golmaal franchise.This part is just simply awesome and comedy apart from the rest parts","Really this first part I really loved apart from the rest three parts.The comedy was awesome funny and enjoyable.The direction was awesome from Rohit Shetty.He really directed this very well.The screenplay was nice.The editing was good.The locations and cinematography were good.The dialouges were hilarious funny and comedy.So what else do we expect from a g9od comedy movie.And bow comes to the acting. Ajay Devgan acted really well.He played his role very well.Arshad warsi,Sharman Joshi and the rest of the actors also acted very good.So guys if U are a true comedy movie lover you will definitely like this one.Go for this." 
" The funniest Bollywood film. Ever!","My summary says it all... The funniest Bollywood film. Ever!This film has an excessive amount of humour prepared to make just about anyone laugh. Although some critics have said the actors do not suit their roles, i think there could be nobody better for them. Ajay Devgan has delivered a humorous yet brilliantly acted role. Arshad Warsi has once again delivered a 100% laughable act that simply keeps you watching. The surprise package is Tushar Kapoor who delivers a praise-worthy performance too as a vocally-challenged person. Sharman Joshi adds to the brilliance of the film and makes himself a now perfect man for comedy.The storyline has both greatly witty and serious scenes. Thus making Golmaal a brilliant film for everyone.10/10"

" A Musst Watch Comedy","It's a lazy afternoon and you have nothing to do. There's always a movie you can pick up and watch even though you have seen it over 10 times. Golmaal is one of them. Is there a plot? No. Is there a life-lesson? Hell no! What Golmaal actually offers is a story of 4 good for nothing pranksters who end up conning their way into the mansion of a blind couple. What crazy events occur next? That's Golmaal.Gopal, Madhav, Lakshman and Lucky are four useless youngsters who do nothing but eat, drink and chill. Due to their unpaid loan to Vasulli bhai, they are on the run. They end up at the mansion of a blind couple who think their grandson has shown up from America. Then starts, Golmaal.The story really does not offer much. However, I feel that just maybe the strength of the movie. It is a film that has its comical moments do the talking more than anything else.There are some classic comedy scenes in the movie. The opening scene defines what the rest of the movie will be. Not to forget other scenes such as when the boys enter the house and have their first meeting with Paresh Rawal.Not to forget when the principle enters Sharman's room. Arshad and Sharman trying to get at Ajay is hilarious.The funniest scenes have to be the valentines day scene when the boys all gift something to Rimi and the Black parody. Just hilarious! Rohit Shetty doesn't have to depend on his directing much. It's the writing that's the strongest point. By writing, I mean the dialogue. The lines are rib tickling.The music is a pleasant surprise. Reh ja reh ja is my favorite. The title song is amusing. Kyun aage aage is a treat to watch and a master stroke.Rohit Shetty's direction is first rate. He handles all the scenes with ease.Golmaal is full of talented actors. All the actors perform to an equal level of competency. Ajay Devgan is a revelation in this one. His comedy is subtle yet extremely funny. Arshad Warsi is a scene stealer, as always. Sharman joshi gives a very good act. Tusharr Kapoor is first rate and he doesn't even speak a word in the film. Rimi Sen does well Paresh Rawal is as always, perfect. Manoj Joshi is brilliant. Ditto for Sanjay Mishra and Mukesh Tiwari.Overall - A film you can watch anytime, anywhere. Strongly recommended!" 
" Hilarious!","Four ex-college students get kicked from their college(yes they are still in there college for 10 years) and while on the run from a gangster hides in a house of a blind couple.The story is good but its not perfect and has its loopholes. But comedies are not meant to be perfect anyway. But it provides the laugh and the fun factor a comedy promises.Performance wise, i thought the performance of the underdog Tusshar Kapoor was the best among the four. Sharwan Johsi, Arsad Warsi and Ajay Devgan suited their role and are fantastic in this film. The four have great rapport on screen and their comic timing is fabulous. Paresh Rawal is as always good though he didn't have many comic lines. Rimi Sen didn't have much to do expect look pretty and dance on numbers.The music is very good. Especially the title track.Screenplay is good and moves the story forward at a good pace.This film is highly recommended from me. Its hilarious all the way. Its just superb!" 
" It was a superb movie","@ Ganesh Salian (salianmoviereview) Don't know from which part of the world have you came from. You must be liking movies like houseful and tees mar khan if you didn't like Golmaal Golmaal is a complete fun, and if you observe each scene it's going to make you laugh more :D The Movie is worth watching a number of times Arshad Warsi, Sharman Joshi and Tushar Kapoor have played the characters perfectly I lol'd a lot watching the movie. Overall, the movie is great! One of the best Indian Comedy Movies Though the sequels were not as funny as the first part It is the best comedy movie i have liked by date after Andaaz Apna Apna Enjoy watching the movie" 
" Complete Joshing movie","The movie was fabulous and a great entertainer which is full of excitement and comedy. I liked the performance of Tusshar Kapoor, Ajay Devgan and above Paresh Rawal. The art direction was good. The peppy music of Vishal and Shekhar enhanced the proceedings.Manoj Joshi scenes were hilarious. Arshad Warsi's performance was too good.And Rimi Sen looked sexy and hot. Manoj Tiwari was not up to the mark.The post-intervals scenes were more good. And my favorite song is Golmaal.Sharman Joshi was quite good and hope to see him in more powerful roles than this." 
" watch","Before writing anything else, let me tell you, this movie is a comedy all the way from start to end. Also has to warn you that this is not a film for which you have to go with your brain. No need of that, because if you go with your brain you may start ask questions and that is not good.Plot 4 college friends (Ajay Devgan, Thushar Kapoor, Arshad Warsi & Sharman Joshi) take every chance to loot many to spend their lavish life in the hostel and to repay a big loan they have taken. Every trick in the book was tried to get money, even playing hate each other in public or collecting funds by saying the principal is sick with cancer. The four got dismissed from the college, when they sold the exam question paper to students, which they took from the principal who came to advise Lakshmi (Sharman). Circumstances land them to the house of a blind couple, played by Paresh Rawal & Sushmita Mukherji. The 4 observed that they are waiting for their grandson from US. Knowing they are blind, they decided to get into the house, acting as their grandson. By accident Paresh Rawal touches Laksmi, but he was not confident of handling the situation and Gopal (Ajay) did the dialogues. The rest two are always around to keep the confusion (or comedy). Sanjay Mishra have a diamond interest in the blind couple couple as well, since some of their diamonds are with the blind couple which they leave with them to escape from the customs (the couple is not aware of that). Rimi Sen is the neighbor of the blind couple and the 4 is deewana hue paagal against Rimi. The story ends where all things are sorted out and Rimi express her love interest and the blind couple punishes the 4. It is up to you to watch out for more.Plus Points Very good dialogues, competent acting, some excellent situations where comedy executed in it's beauty and laugh a minute comic scenes in rest of the body.Performance The Comedy King of Today, Paresh Rawal is restricted to an average role, without any chance for him to do the comedy, where rest of the comrades took the challenge. Still, his acting was quite adequate. Sushmita Mukherji is OK, though her character is not convincing. The pair's love song from the 60s is a laugh a second treat and the song stand alone from rest of the film, where the song itself is a class product but rest of the film is for masses ." 
" Fun in parts...but missing a plot ?","I enjoyed watching the movie and even laughed out loud in parts. But you would have to pay me something in 6 figures and in £'s to make me see it again.Its just a lot of gags strung together, without a storyline to really bind them together...also, to my distaste, the film-makers (continuing a long-standing bollywood trend) opt to take the easy route to laughs by making fun of people with physical disabilities...(one of the 4 friends is dumb and the couple whose house they run to is blind).Most of the actors are wasted in the movie...barring Arshad Warsi (usual spontaneous self) and Sharman Joshi (i saw him for the first time and was really impressed)." 
" Hilarious but mindless!","I rented Golmaal's DVD just because Ajay Devgan is my favorite actor.But after watching this movie,I was shocked by his choice of signing his movies.He has portrayed quite a number of substantial roles in the past and continues to do so,but I haven't really figured out his judgment in selecting his commitments till now. Anyway,Golmaal is a good slapstick comedy,meant for time-pass only.Arshad Warsi,as usual,stands out in this movie too.The surprise package is Tushar Kapoor who delivers a praise-worthy performance too as a vocally-challenged person.Sharman Joshi leaves a lot to be asked for.His best performance still remains his portrayal of Sukhi in "Rang De Basanti".Ajay Devgan is flawless,but these kinds of roles don't really suit him. The movie,as a whole,is well packaged and well cinematographed.The content is weak,and despite the not-so-good reviews by the critics,the movie went on to be a major commercial hit. We know that mindless comedies still do work in the subcontinent.This movie is a perfect example." 
" Torture Unlimited","Oh my god! My head is still aching... I cannot believe my friends recommended this movie to me and "Wait... the next scene will be a nice one, I'm sure" is what I kept on thinking throughout the movie until I realized it had ended. Now I am seriously very fond of comedy but I do believe that its not everyone's cup of tea. Rohit Shetty (Zameen, another disastrous flick) was his debut film and the director goes from bad to worse in Golmaal. A movie starring comic actors like Paresh Rawal, Arshad Warsi, Sharman Joshi and Tushhar Kapoor for that sake (Kya Kool Hai Hum), I expected Golmaal to be good if not great but the movie falls flat. The scenes are not funny. Tusshar will get some marks from me for his performance. Arshad Warsi manages to make his presence felt. Vrajesh Hirjee is competent. Other than that rest of the entire cast disappoints. Ajay Devgan is sad and Rimi Sen needs to try out something different than doing movies in which she's the only beauty in the entire world and guys get engaged in a cat-and-mouse game to impress her (Deewane Huey Pagal???), its irritating now.The music of Golmaal is decent but it cannot rescue a movie this bad. The title track "Golmaal" is pleasing to the ears and the video of "Aage Peeche" is funny when viewed individually but in the movie as a whole, it didn't help much. Rohit Shetty tried so hard to make a scene look funny but that's all that this movie is, a wannabe. Even the worst of the comedy genres do have scenes which'll make you laugh but Golmaal is just sad. In Bollywood, what hurts me is that creativity without commercial success is meaningless. Look at Nagesh Kukunoor. After making masterpieces like Hyderabad Blues, Rockford and 3 Deewarein, he got noticed only after Iqbal (another brilliant movie) got big and that was because on the producer's seat sat Mr. Richie Rich Ghai. Golmaal, too no matter how bad was a hit at the Box office and therefore, they've decided to make a sequel of it :(. I just hope they know what they're doing and I wish it fails miserably at the Box Office.3.5/10 from muviegeek.blogspot.com" 
" Something same yet something different","It was about time the Hindi film industry produced a good comedy. There has been a drought in the comic genre of movies since the sensation caused by Munnabhai MBBS, Hera Pheri prior to that and Andaaz Apna Apna if you ponder further down. If you've followed the trend of the comic movies that have been produced in recent times, you would agree me when I say there has been a sudden deluge of movies which convey humor using a unbearable number of innuendos. This has led to the narrowing down of comic movie audiences across India where usage of expletives is not appreciated par innuendo or otherwise. At the very outset Golmal would give you the exact same feeling. The three protagonists dancing among a flock of bikini clad ladies and a start sans any direction for around 30 minutes will give you the same Akshay Kumar comedy feel. Id suggest, don't leave yet because out of no-where an interesting new plot pops up and I assure you its a laugh riot after this point. The rapport between the three jests of the movie is good with Ajay Devgan trying a comic role, Sharman Joshi(RDB guy...Sukhi) playing the innocent scapegoat to perfection and of course Arshad Warsi playing a role in his "home ground" . Rimi sen was a disappointment but I guess a movie in which a 'heroine' was absolutely unnecessary one cant except much. Paresh Raawal was wasted in a serious role and not taking anything away from him since he played the role of the blind old man to perfection along with Susmita Mukherjee (u must have seen her in many TV comedies) playing his wife very well. There are things that are similar to the previous comedies like the intermittent usage of innuendos but what impressed me the most the refreshing usage of a flashback sequence with a 1950's duet song feel where the hero woes the heroine. This was quite a delectation. Other than that there are a few other good jokes in the movie. As usual the finale and the global plot of the movie was below par and in fact outright rubbish. It was a like a good idea extremely badly executed. You also have the clichéd "running around in confusion" fight sequence in the end. The music is trendy with some foot tapping numbers and again the black and white 1950s track is what got me to give the movie a 7/10. All in all if u you are not in total aversion to slapstick comedy you will have a great time and will laugh your stomach off through out the movie. I'd say go watch the movie if you are bored and want something to cheer you up because you will be in splits for most of the movie but if you are looking for a comedy of the caliber of Namakhalaal and Hera Pheri, well you can pass.Rating: Acting: 6/10 Comedy: 8/10 Plot : 5/10 Climax: 0/10 Overall : 7/10" 
" golmol and not golmaal","when i heard of this movie i thought the this movie is replica of earlier movie of amol palekar (character) -golmaal . however after seeing the movie i realized that treasures of old movies is not their in new movies and so in new golmal this movie is hilarious and keep you smiling all thru movie my favorite is Paresh Rawal. he is genius ,delivers what is nearly perfect. in the movie he is one character who holds it and keep it alive others specially Tusshar Kapoor and Sharman Joshi are speechless in acting , but circuit arshad varsi is graceful in the movie and has capacity to keep audience happy specially with his tapori kind of role Ajay Devgan -action hero fits into comio role to some extent and keep the movie running the verdict of audience is that this movie is worth watching as good entertainer , please don't look for story bye" 
" a very bad comedy film","not at all happening a very bad comedy film and some very silly jokes are used and the songs are rubbish as ever so don't watch it bcoz u will not like it i just wasted my time watching it in the hall. it was also a wastage of money. after the role of circuit in munnabhai i could not believe that arshad warsi could have been in this film. i feel sorry for arshad warsi to be in this film. tushar kapoor of course never could have been in good films will of course be present here. so my advice to everybody not to watch this film and watch good comedies like malamaal weekly and hera pheri but just don't disappoint yourself by watching this film."
