" Brilliant.","Having watched Parineeta twice in a gap of 4 days since it's release, I have to say, this movie after a long time has done India Cinema proud. The film managed to keep my attention the same as watching it for the first time that says a lot about the film.The cinematography is extremely good, tight and i must say not a frame of film wasted. Each scene is art directed very well and the lighting is perfect.One can clearly see that the research done on this film is very good. The wardrobes of all actors have been well designed including the kind of jewelry the women wore. Great detailing. Just one flaw I have to mention is the choice of sunglasses Saif wears. A little too modern.The male ego and attitude will not come as a surprise to most Indian men but the character and pride of an Indian woman is showcased very well and aptly. I only wish more writers and directors adapt this image of the Indian women instead of taking her into extremes all the time.The music, absolutely outstanding. Shantanu Moitra has done an excellent job with the score and you will definitely want the soundtrack in your collection.It's not easy to make a period film. Kudos to the cast, crew, production and anyone involved in the making of this film. They should all be extremely pleased.A must watch." 
" A mature bollywood flick after a long time","I was really impressed with the movie. Although the story is (again) built around a relationship triangle but the twist to the story is quite different from the usual plot line that you see in Hindi movies. Vidya Balan definitely stole the show with her natural and subtle acting (most of the Indian actors/actresses are known for their exaggerated expressions, which are more suitable for theater than for movies), kudos to her. Sanjay Dutt was good as usual and Saif is improving with time. Besides the main lead everybody pitched in with pretty good acting, giving the movie an overall balance. In particular Raima Sen and her friend (don't know her name) were very good. One of the surprises were seeing Rekha (yeah!) as a club singer in one of the songs :), she's still able to pull it off. We need more movies like this, and overall, I would recommend others to watch this movie." 
" A milestone for Indian Film Industry",""Parineeta" is based on a classic Indian novel, and the movie is probably the third or fourth remake of the novel. The plot/story of the movie is of the nature that could SO EASILY have been a big blunder at the box office. I had no intentions to go see the movie since I felt it would be a serious waste of my time and money.As time went by, the movie became more and more popular amongst masses. I grew compelled to see what really made it so. But props to the Parineeta team to choose a wonderful star cast that drove me to see the film. Saif Khan's recent performances and of course Sanjay Dutt motivated me to go see the film.Still not expecting much, I have no words to explain it, but I was truly shocked by the direction, editing of the movie backed by some of the best acting and screenplay I have seen in the Indian Film Industry. The movie, 130 minutes long, is also unlike other Indian movies which run easily 150+ minutes. The movie is crisp, and edited to perfection. Saif Khan and Sanjay Dutt were great like always, but Vidya Balan surprised me in her debut film.This movie has set a new standard for Indian films. I like the direction in which Indian films are headed. 2004-05 has been a break through year for actors, directors for the Indian Film Industry, and movies like Parineeta is the fruit for the efforts." 
" Beautiful portrayal of the city Calcutta(Kolkata) and its culture","For a nation starved of creatively fulfilling cinema, Vidhu Vinod Chopra's Parineeta is like a dream come true. If you overlook the overindulgence in melodrama in the last few reels of the film, Parineeta may well classify as a classic entertainer with brilliant performances, outstanding music and superb production values. Based on Saratchandra Chatterjee's novel, Parineeta is the story of two childhood friends - Lolita (newcomer Vidya Balan) and Shekhar (Saif Ali Khan), both hailing from different strata of society. They share an unspoken bond of love. Enter Girish (Sanjay Dutt) from London. Shekhar is driven to jealousy by the growing affections between Girish and Lolita. A series of circumstances manipulated by Shekhar's father Naveen Rai force the two lovers apart amidst a series of misunderstandings and betrayals. Parineeta is the story of a woman's endless wait for her love and director Pradeep Sarkar weaves the story like magic, especially in the first half. The relationship between Lolita and Shekhar is beautifully established right from the beginning. Sarkar excels in the detailing - the vintage look of the film stands out with authentic costumes, props and even the roads of Kolkata. Which makes the deliberate plugs of brands like Saridon and Cadbury stand out sorely. Some of the sequences haunt you much after the film is over: Shekhar's complex state of mind during his marriage with Gayatri (Dia Mirza) and his confrontation scenes with Lolita. Girish's first encounter with Lolita and Saif's anguish as he helplessly watches his love slip by are excellent. The scene in the recording studio is worth a mention. Full marks to Vinod Chopra and Sarkar for a deft screenplay. Sarkar's picturisations of Piyu Bole and Soona Mann Ka Aangan are mesmerising. The background score is heavily inspired by 1942: A Love Story. Perhaps the only problem with the film lies in its script and maybe contemporarising it would have helped. In the second half, the script stumbles. And then comes the worst part - the climax. The wall breaking scene between shouts from family and friends screaming, "Todh, Shekhar todh!" is so amateur that it dilutes the whole film's impact. All the performances are top class - Vidya Balan makes a sensational debut. Whether it's her coy demeanour with Saif or her confusion with Sanjay, Vidya is an absolute delight. Sanjay Dutt is in super form. Sabyasachi Chakraborty as Saif's father is brilliant. Among the others, Raima Sen and Ninad Kamat (as Shekhar's friend) add enormously to the film despite their miniscule parts. But Parineeta really belongs to Saif Ali Khan. It's his best performance to date. Khan showcases a plethora of emotions, all in right doses - jealousy, compassion, callousness, insecurity, resentment and joy. It's hard to imagine any other actor playing the role. With this film, Saif rightfully acquires his position in the top rung of the industry. If Parineeta falls short of being a masterpiece, it's only due to the few howlers in the latter half. But even the chinks in the armour can't rob the film of its sheen. For Hindi cinema, it's a big step forward." 
" A surprising little gem from Bollywood","While this film is far from perfect, it's still a great experience for those who hope for a revival in Indian cinema. The storyline is relatively simple - I haven't read the book it's based on, but can only assume that it was relatively dumbed down for the film. But what makes it special is the entire "package" - no over-the-top acting here, great period sets, smooth narration and actors who give a good dimension to the characters they portray.I think Pradeep Sarkar and Vinod Chopra have to be given due credit for producing this little gem. It's nice to see that their artistic integrity has been (relatively) not compromised here. That's not to say that the film would not appeal to the masses, it has all the elements of a love story in the "Bollywood" genre - song, dance, family melodrama, happy ending etc. - but all these are delicately interwoven into the narrative without losing focus on the story or rather the strong characters. The only complain I had was from the "product placements" that seemed forced and totally out of place in the film :)I am amazed that a film this good was overlooked, by the selection committee, for an entry to the Oscars this year. I am not saying this is a "Pather Panchali" but amongst what was available, it could be argued that this film stood a better chance to find appeal amongst an international audience.My vote Â– 7 out of 10... definitely worth your time!PS: Like another reviewer pointed out here, watch this film on the big screen or its original DVD release that does complete justice to the beautiful cinematography and art direction!" 
" ** Movie that reassures our faith in good cinema **","First things first. Parineeta is a classic. When smart choices like these are made by film makers nothing much can go wrong. Of course, there is always the ever lurking risk of comparison with the novel, but it is safe to say in this movie's case that everyone involved does a wonderful job in executing it on the screen.Vidya Balan(as Lolitha) makes a mind blowing debut. She seems like someone who has been doing this for ages! The natural flow of emotions that she carries in her eyes and so many unsaid words makes you fall in love with her every time she comes on the screen. I am going to go out of my way here and say Lolitha is my kind of a life partner. No two ways about it.Saif Ali Khan (as Shekar Rai) once again proves that he is a horse for the long run. His character is a complex array of emotions - ranging from the musical and romantic to the obedient son of a rich man - and Saif does justice to his role big time. I would definitely recommend him to star in more such classics since it suits him really well.Despite his small (yet very significant) role as the kind hearted gentleman - Girish Babu, Sanjay reassures you why we love him so much. If you were rolling on the floor when he was Munnabhai, you will take a bow to his dignified personification of Girish. A legend without a doubt.All said and done there is one thing which kept haunting me is Sanjay's casting. Call me crazy but somehow Abhishekh Bachchan kept flashing in the mind's eye for Girish's role. He would have been ideal for that role given the range the character covers.Music is just mind blowing. Mitra does an excellent job in recreating the 60s Calcutta and feel of the life in post-British India without a single glitch. My personal favorites are "Piyu Bole...Piya Bole.." and "Kashto Mazza..." shot on the train to Darjeeling.For someone who wants to see a REAL Indian movie this is the great example. If people loved Lagaan for being Indian to the core, this one will definitely make it to their list. Movies like these go to show that one does not have to bare skin and gyrate to remixes to be heard. What is loud and clear are the silences that this movie captures.Well done everyone who were associated with "Parineeta". It was a brilliant and satisfying movie experience.A 10/10 for this pure classic and hope to see more such wonders come out of the think tank of the Indian movie industry. (Calling it Bollywood will not make justice to such gems.)" 
" what can be better...","I have always been a great fan of sharat chanda's literature and seeing it getting transformed to such magnificent movie like vinod chopra's "Parineeta" gives me a sense of pride for our writers and film makers.I saw the movie last evening with my friends and there was none who did not enjoy it. The cinematography is amazing.the sets look far more natural than they were in "Devdas" which was based on the book by the same author. The spirit of the story has been very wisely conserved and the movie displays the efficiency of the director in handling the topic in the very fashion the author would have liked it to be handled. Where "devdas" was a disappointment to me, "Parineeta" has proved the opposite. The movie is far away from the loudness that could have surrounded it. The lights in the sets are dim and add to the romantic mood. thump's up to the makers." 
" One of the best Romances I've seen. Watch out for Vidya Balan.","Plot Outline: Orphaned at childhood Lolita (Vidya Balan) stays with her uncle. She and neighbor Shekhar (Saif) develop innocent bonding with each other which unknown to them has matured into love. It takes the arrival of Girish (Sanjay Dutt) before the lead pair discovers their love for each other through circumstantial odds and family pressures.Comment: Parineeta is an adaptation of Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay's work, whose works include the immortal Devdas that has been remade over and over again in many languages. Although, it is quite usual to compare Vinod Chopra's Parineeta with Bhansali's Devdas, I would say that Parineeta ranks way above latter in terms of being closer to real life and portraying seemingly real characters as against the recent Devdas was more of a visual treat with stars and extravaganza.Although Vinod Chopra, in his screenplay has deviated from the novel's portrayal of the 1920's to the film's 1960's, it is seamless and is believably real. The performances are extremely neat with Saif in a mature role and Vidya Balan exceptional for a dÃ©butante, both in looks and ease with the camera. Talent spotter Vinod Chopra has her lined up in Munnabhai-2 and Yagna. Sanjay Dutt seemed older than what the role required. Among the songs that are well timed, 'Piyu Bole' has freshness similar to 1942: A Love Story. Although Pradeep Sarkar's direction has made the movie well paced, the closing scenes have been extra-dramatized. Must watch for all audiences.Rating: 4/5" 
" A must watch !","The FILM:I have recently watched the movie Parineeta. I was highly impressed by the way the movie was setup. The director has been very meticulous in creating the feel of the old era. There was not a single point in the film where one could say that the backdrop of the film was not contiguous. The film was a very great experience.Characters: Vidya Balan was exceptionally good. In fact the ease with which she played the character, makes one wonder if she is a dÃ©butante. I must say that she has done justice to the character. Well done Vidhu Vinod Chopra, you have again found a VERY talented young lady. Saif showed that he has matured as an actor and is very versatile in the kind of roles that he has been offered. Saif's acting in this film was awesome. I think Saif can challenge any film critic who questions his abilities to act. He has emerged into a fabulous actor. And with this film he has put himself in line for an award. That goes for Vidya too.RATING: I did not give a 10/10 just because of the climax of the film. It did not have to be so melodramatic." 
" Elegant, memorable storytelling","I will never forget the first 30 minutes of this film.Superbly paced, the film has fine, balanced performances from all its actors. Its vision is very difficult to put in words - it is an escapism rooted in realism, simple ideas seen earlier in Hindi cinema are fully realized here, comparable to some of the best personal European/ International films. Its song style is sophisticated, very effortlessly translated into simple, clear imagery. The last ten minutes are mishandled, taking away from what could have been an almost-flawless experience in mainstream Indian cinema - I choose my words very carefully, this is an Indian film in Hindi. Very precious." 
" Movie of the year!","This has got to be the best movie of the year.This was a directors' movie through and through and what a great job he did! Watching this movie also makes you wonder how Devdas would have fared with Pradeep Sarkar at the helm.This guy has an absolute mastery of the medium , thats for sure.The cinematography and WRITING was amazing.It was after very a long time that I heard such beautiful dialogs on screen, brimming with subtext.There was this particular shot of Howrah bride at night which is still etched in my memory.The only OTT/false tone/temporary bhansali insanity occurred at the end..( toddo shekhar todddo!), somehow did not sit well with the tone of the movie.The first song was brilliant in its exposition of the childhood of the major protagonists of the movie.The songs were VERY good and actually fit the tone/mood of the movie. There was a VERY authentic recreation of the 60's, Calcutta has not been captured like this in recent times.The art director of this movie deserves an Oscar ! The 3 major actors were on point, not a false note from anyone.Saif has given his most mature performance yet and damn he looks hot in a sherwani! Vidya Balan is very good for her first movie and more importantly she "fits" her role to a T.Sanju has this kind of role down to a science- his sad eyes and world weary demeanor speak volumes.There were some VERY sensually picturised love scenes! Also the cameos by raima sen , diya mirza and the guy who played ajeet were great! What can i can , i LOVED this movie." 
" A must see","I recently saw Parineeta(2005). Sitting there, watching the movie, I felt like I was watching a beautiful 1960's movie. Myself being a great fan of old movies, which are clean and free from stunts, harsh language, nudity. It is a movie well done by V.V. Chopra. During the entire movie, I was not able to get up to take a break. There are two things in this movie that could have been avoided. The dramatic climax and the small, but there, bedroom sequence with Sanjay Dutt. Other than that, a wonderful movie. After Munna Bhai MBBS, this was the movie I could watch with family. Vidya balan, despite being a dÃ©butant, has done justice to her role. She is a natural. Saif Ali Khan has once again proved himself. He just needs good roles like this one. He is so natural with the acting. Sanjay Dutt, matured as ever, looks great as Girish Babu. A great, must see movie." 
" Worship Vidya Balan!","I've just seen Parineeta - and I honestly can not tell you whether I think it a good movie or not. The reason? Vidya Balan. Dearest God, what a woman! 1. She's pretty. Not in the MTV-showing-skin-think-of-me-naked pretty, but unearthly, religiously pretty. Even though she almost bears it all in this movie (in one of the best hot scenes I have ever, ever seen), she manages to keep the radiance and presence of a true angel. Even Serafs would start singing to her instead of Gods glory if she would walk past.2. She's a very good actress. And with that I mean Indian actress. She's able to convey emotions effectively, which is the core of acting of course, but there's just so many little typical Indian details in her acting: gestures she makes, the movement of her eyes and eyebrows, her body language, that shows: she took her acting lessons from Old School Indian Cinema - all the way from Meena Kumari, Nargis, Nutan, via Hema Malini, Rekha (who makes a stunning guest appearance, too!), Sridevi and, my all time favourite, Mahuri Dixit. Believe me when I say this lady is a legend in the making! So, whilst watching Parineeta I could do nothing but watch enthralled every time Vidya graced the silver screen with her radiance. For what it's worth, I did notice a few other things as well though: 1. Saif Ali Khan. After seeing him first in Kal Ho Naa Ho, I had my doubts. Sure, he's eye-candy for the ladies, but can he act? In Kal Ho Naa Ho, he couldn't - but he shows that he does have the talent here: he does a good job at portraying the anguished Shekhar, and to be honest, I think the director could have gotten more out of him: the movie does not show enough of either his or Vidya/Lolita's doubts, troubles and inner thoughts to really test their mettle. So, compliments for him.2. Sabyasachi Chakravarthy (who plays shekhars dad). He plays the guy you just love to hate very well - even so effectively that you don't even feel for him when, during the climax of the movie, his little scams and self-built empire come apart. I thought that scene was not really a good scene: he was so unlikeable that as an actor he surely felt it would have been weird to show the despair his character must have felt. But apart from that scene, he is doing such a good job at being the dislikeable $%#&@&@, that he is just worthy of praise.3. Sanjay Dutt. he was nominated for best supporting actor here, and he should have gotten it. Even though I thought he was better at supporting in, for example, Eklavya, he is so very able to give a character dimension and depth within just a few seconds, that he just deserves that award.4. I do think the plot/script could have been a bit better written. The biggest problem I had was this: why didn't Lolita at least try to tell the truth about Shekhar's dad evil scheming earlier on? Now I understand as a person, why that is difficult, but why didn't we, as viewers, at least see more of Lolita's doubts about that, and more of Shekhars confusion over Lolita's then erratic behavior? Sure, I get why we also need to buy into the eternal deep love thing to really feel the tragedy of them being separated, but the tragedy-part is equally important, and this is where it got blunted a bit: the movie focused too much first on how great they are together, and then on their confusion over possibly marrying other people in stead of each other (the arrival of Girish for Lolita and that Paris Hilton avant la lettre for Shekhar) and too little on the pains and misconceptions Shekhar's dad's manipulative moves caused directly. I didn't feel that they were 'caged' as characters need to be in a tragedy, I still felt their was room for manouvre, and I didn't really believe that they didn't take the room which they too my mind had.Or maybe I was just too happy every time I saw Vidya Balan too really be able to empathise with the lovely sad love story this ultimately is. It's just hard to feel the tragic melancholy of it all when you believe your watching a divine presence.So, come to think of it, it is a good movie, really. I think I have to watch it again, just for Vidya Ba..the good plot, of course." 
" What a wonderful movie!","I have not enjoyed such a wonderful movie in years.I don't watch very many Hindi movies but decided to watch this one when I watched an interview of Vidhu Vinod Chopra on MTV. The few clips that I saw during the interview convinced me that the movie was one of the best Hindi movies ever made.Everything about the movie is enchanting- the music, the wonderful shots of Calcutta at dusk, at sunrise, in the winter fog, in autumn, the churches, the old houses with their colonial architecture, the warm portrayal of those exquisite times, the delicate filigree of relationships, the simplicity of the childhood bond that describes the relationship between Lolita and Shekhar, the realism of the story. Everything was absolutely marvelous.I have never doubted Saif Khan's great talent and my faith in him was vindicated in the movie. He plays his role with great finesse.The heroine may be debuting in this movie but she will definitely go places. She is talented, she is graceful, she is beautiful without having to thrust her body at the camera to capture the audience's attention. I sat enthralled through the love scenes that reminded me of a watercolor painted with a very fine brush.The music was absolutely wonderful and captured the sound of the 60s. Every song was a treat--not just the music but the picturisation especially "piyuh bole".All through the movie I sat and marveled at the amount of work that had gone into the making of such a film. The research, the reproduction, the faithful details(even the oven that was used to bake a cake!) There are only two aspects of the film that jarred. One was the casting of Sanjay Dutt as Girish. I like Sanjay and he was super in Munna Bhai but he looked too old in his role here. The other thing that somehow spoilt things was the Sanjay Leila Bhansali moment that crept into the movie towards the end. Even so, if the movie were to be compared with(I confess that it is an unfair comparison) Devdas, Pareenita would win hands down. For all the song and dance hoopla of Devdas, the movie failed to tug at one's heart strings. For me the most wonderful thing was the fact that both my children, young teenagers, enjoyed the movie and loved it.Thank you, Pradeep Sarkar and Vidhu Vinod Chopra!" 
" A romantic journey back to the past","I just happened to watch Parineeta here in Bangkok, though in the beginning I thought of clinging to some another "oot-patang" type Bollywood flick but i got amazed at its simplicity and the authenticity which the producers and director have tried to maintain throughout, everything in the movie is so simple and original,the story, the sets, the wardrobe, make-up, and the overall treatment is marvelous, there is no violence and melodrama, all the players have acted well no overacting or over projection. All the intimate scenes in the movie have been handled artistically and with aesthetics. Parineeta takes the viewer back into the by-gotten era. it is just like your childhood memories bringing smiles on your face!" 
" A great journey after a very long time.","A very good film after a very long time. The research done for the film is compelling and very evident through the sets and the clothes throughout the film. The direction was truly outstanding as the flow of the film was like beautiful music. All the songs are amazingg and have been choreographed beautifully. The screenplay, locations, background score and acting have made this film a great journey. This film has introduced one of the most beautiful faces to come to India cinema in the last decade and it is Vidya Balan. She is truly a perfect representation of a beautiful Indian woman. She has acted really well and if it wasn't for Rani Mukharji in Black, I would give the best actress award to Vidya Balan in a heartbeat. However I hope that every award ceremony for Bollywood should give the best new comer of the year award to Vidya Balan for the outstanding performance that left me awestruck. Saif was good doing a different kind of character in this film. It was a good change as he is starting to prove himself to be able to do a variety of roles. Sanjay has always stood up to his mark. He has done what he does best and has done it very well. Raima Sen and Diya Mirza have very small roles but they have done their part very well. Both ladies help add grace and charm to this very graceful and charming film. Except for one flaw, more of a similarity to Devdas in a very small way. Just like in Devdas where Sharukh and Ash were childhood best friends and fall in love and then get separated as both get married to different people, in Parineete, Saif and Vidya are childhood best buddies who fall in love and are ALMOST separated and Almost married to different people. But this flaw does not reduce any points from this film as both films though with some similarities are done very differently and very beautifully. Devdas was great and Parineeta is great too if not greater. (for me greater than devdas 2002). All in all, I would give this film 9/10 as it was almost flawless and kept me gripped from start to finish. A great journey and a must watch for every Indian movie lover."
