" A RGV Film!!! Who Said That?","Is it from the same man who gave us masterpieces like Satya, Company and of course the original Shiva? And on top of all that, he has also made Rangeela and Sarkar. Quite a resume, I should say.But what has he done now? A remake of his own film (I have seen the original and wasn't able to find any remarkable similarities) which is so bad that you almost refuse to believe the credits which end on Ram Gopal Verma's name as being the producer and the director. I had always thought that a good producer and director are the best criteria to help you choose when you are randomly browsing the shelves with an intent to buy something good. Actors can fail, Actresses can fail, writers can fail, music-composers can fail, but good directors almost always deliver.There! I said it. I answered my own querry that I hadn't yet raised. Almost. Even then, how bad can bad be when a good helmer is on controls, one might ask. My answer will be: you never know with these guys. Steven Spielberg can give you a Hook; Oliver Stone can helm an Alexander; Coppola can open a Cotton Club;Yash Chopra can churn out a Veer-Zara; Gulzar can rehash a Ho To Tu; and Ram Gopal Verma can make a remake to make you want to tear your hair out.I have bracketed him in such an august gathering because I believe that he is just as capable and as true to his craft as all these greats. The RGV that I know does not make compromises, does not hesitate from experimenting, does not fear to hold very risky projects in his hands, and has a unique vision all his own. All qualities of the Great.But this time he has gone off the track with such force that I think I must pay him a visit and feel him all over, just to see that if all his bones are in one piece.There is nothing good one can say about this movie. Not even one. I am not much well-versed in the technical aspects of a film but as far as the 'artistic' elements go, this is a sure-fire dud. No performance to speak about, no music to speak about, no action-pieces to speak about (positively, I mean), in short, no nothing' to speak about.I wonder what was this dude thinking while making this film. Probably, about that other remake he is doing. That is not one of his own oldies. And that too is a classic of its genre. A true classic if India has to offer one in this genre, actually. Let's just hope, he keeps his wits about while doing this other job. As far as this remake goes, let's just forget it and never speak of it and every time when somebody tries to stick a thorn in our sides by saying that that was a RGV film too, to counter it vehemently with: A RGV Film!!! Who Said That?" 
" RGV's very hard work to undress Nisha Kothari","Mockery, ridicule, joke etc, many words can describe this movie. Looks like Ram Gopal Verma produced and directed a movie with just an intention to undress Nisha Kothari. But I just keep guessing, why work so hard for that? I seriously cant believe that RGV made this movie himself. Some people might not even agree with this, but I think at least they bothered to change the end or at least tried to. Same old base, same plot, story etc. But still, for some reason, I still think that this could have been a better film. Some good actors like Upendra Limaye and Ranvir Shorey were totally wasted. Mohit Alhawat might be a good actor, but needs to come out of the shadow of Ram Gopal Verma. On the other hand, Nisha Kothari will last in the film industry as long as she stays in the shadow of RGV, or should I say, as long as she keeps exposing for him. 2 stars" 
" Very good movie.","One thing I have learned is not to believe the critics and judge a movie just by reading there Reviews.Shiva is surprisingly a very good movie with good action and a very good story. The story has been seen in many movies before: A cop coming to a town which is ruled by gangsters and the head is a minister, but they way RGV has directed the movie and told the story is brilliant.I have never doubted that the Main Actor in this movie has very good potential in being a Big Actor one day, he has got the looks and most of all his acting is very good. This is his second movie after James where he did a great job as well, and lifted the entire movie on his shoulder. The actress is OK but she still needs to take some acting classes if she want to stick in Bollywood.Overall it is a very good movie, and don't judge the movie before you have seen it, I have and I loved it..:)" 
" Shiva....","This is a typical story about nexus between politician, police and criminals. Numerous films have been made in the same theme like Satya, Arjun. Honestly speaking, Shiva is no extraordinary movie. This is no exception. Shiva as the typical hero of a Hindi movie fights evil. And has got no supporting hands except the sexy Nisha Kothari who plays his inspiration.Actor Mohit Ahlawat played his role beautifully. Nisha Kotahri has been brought to add some glamor quotient to the movie. All other characters are so so. Action sequences are good. So is the cinematography. A typical Ram Gopal Verma film."
