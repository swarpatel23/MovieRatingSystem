Sunny Deol is completely unparallel and no other actor can play the role of Tara Singh except sunny.This movie is meant for Sunny and he proves it why he is called Action King of Bolywood.But other than action Gadar has solid plot of India-Pakistan Partition tale and a love story. Brilliant work by rest of the starcast too including Ameesha patel,Vivek Shauq,Lillete Dubey and above all Amrish Puri. And what to say about the massive craze of this movie outside cinema halls all over the India when it was released on 15th june 2001.No dabang or 3 idiots can come even near the shadow of Gadar's poularity.I still remember when i watched movie ,it was a housefull show in PARAS cinema,Kurukshetra even on the 50th day after the release and audience reaction whenever Sunny Deol uttered any dialogue,Absolutely matchless. Gadar is a landmark fim in the history of Indian cinema in terms of gross collection when adjusted to inflation. Yes It is superior to 3 idiots,ETT, Dabang etc.Its has footfalls of more than 4 crores, which is a record till date.","imdb_rating":10,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" Brilliant!","review":"This is definitely one of Sunny Deol's best action movies ever, as simply gives a complex character the performance of a life-time. Watch this action movie with an open mind, and you will realize the realistic bravery and power that he exudes on the silver screen. Only Sunny Deol could pull this one off with total Ã©lan. This is a novel plot (based on the painful partition after independence in the late 40's). It looks so realistic to the point that no other current hero could have aced this role like Sunny Deol did. It is NOT aimed at running down Pakistan because Sunny Deol's Sardarji character is married to a Pakistani girl after he saves her from attacks as he believes in humanity. All he wants to do is keep his family together as one. Sunny Deol brilliantly fights hard to save the day and cow down his in-laws. People should understand that like his dad, Dharmendra, Sunny Deol has that fire, intensity, and command (unlike that overrated SRK)! Anyways, watch this and enjoy it! 12/10!","imdb_rating":10,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" Sunny's best in a long time!","review":"The issue the story tries to tackle is essential because from a historical standpoint, this really happened. The acting from Sunny Deol, Amita Patel, and Amrish Puri are awesome. The film deserved an award. The director Anil Sharma did a great job in creating different moods at appropriate times in the movie. I recommend it to everybody.","imdb_rating":10,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" A true patriotic Indian movie","review":"Gadar is one of the best movies I have ever seen. Performances by Sunny & Amisha are superb. Sunny has delivered his best ever performance. He is equally matched by Amisha who looks very beautiful in the movie. The music is also superb. Gadar is a true story based on the partition of India.It is one of the biggest hits of bollywood and is a movie every Indian should see. Perhaps the only ones who wouldn't like this movie will be PakistanisÂ.","imdb_rating":10,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" WOW - thats it!","review":"The movie apart from having a good story, good performances and good direction also has reflected upon reality.I was not expecting much from this movie. But that turned out to be the best part.Pakistan was a part India before 1947. It was created on the basis of religion and hatred. That hatred has not settled down still (and probably never will). It was at its peak immediately after the Britishers left.How do the Pakistan politicians exploit the religion and hatred against India to their own advantage is shown in the movie for real. Even educated and open-minded Pakistanis have accepted and appreciated this. Apart from the \"reality\" point of view, this movie has some visually great scenes like the one where Tara escapes to India from Pakistan in a goods-train. Nice work by the team as a whole.The story starts with how there was hatred and killings on both the sides during partition. And how the girl Sakeena (Ameesha Patel) is separated from her family in the chaos of so many people moving from either sides to the other. She being left alone in the \"opposite\" side results in the people trying to molest her. Tara (Sunny Deol) stops people from doing that to a girl separated from her family. He has to bear the brunt of opposing his own people for someone whose people have killed and tortured women of his (sunny's) own. But he sticks to his.Love blooms between this uneducated poor truck driver and the educated rich girl and they get married and have a son. After years of Sakeena living in the ignorance that her parents are dead, she sees a picture in a local daily newspaper that shows her father to have become a prominent political figure in Pakistan. She has a desire to go meet her parent and Tara has no objection to it. But once she reaches her parents, they use her to earn political mileage by projecting her as a brave girl who fought against India's tortures for years and finally returned to her homeland.She is shocked to know that she is not allowed to return to her husband and son. Even Tara Singh, the husband, is denied visa to Pakistan.The movie then shows how a insignificant truck driver Tara has to fight the powerful bureaucracy/political figures to get his wife back to his home. His trauma and bravery are very nicely shown.The well-known loud verbal-exchanges between Sunny Deol-Amrish Puri in this movie are too good to miss.A must see for all those who don't have a clue as to what happened during the partition era.I give it 8 out of 10.","imdb_rating":8,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" Great film","review":"A warm film and essentially a love story.Great music, comedy, acting, classic Sunny D action, cinematography, and an engaging story - what more can you ask for. It's one of the few Hindi movies that isn't ripping off a Hollywood film. Consistently holds up to repeated viewings.Look for yet another superb performance by the late great Amrish Puri, look for sexy, buxom Amisha Patel, and Punjab's own Sunny Deol. This film really put him on another level, unfortunately films like Jo Bole or Hero are higher budget, but much lesser in content. This film though is one of the greatest films I've ever seen from Hindi cinema.","imdb_rating":10,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" must watch for all indians","review":"after a very long time we see a period film attempted in India on such a large scale.Sunny Deol had a lot at stake and man did it pay off.Its being declared as the biggest hit of all times.Sunny and Amisha deliver performances of a life time.National award and other awards belong to him..no doubt. If you are an Indian and love your country then there is no way you would'nt like the movie.Its the best and a must watch for all true Indians.DON'T MISS THIS ONE.","imdb_rating":10,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" One of the Best Indian (Hindi) movies","review":"If there is one movie that I would pick as one of the best movies that the Indian Film Industry has produced, it has to be-\"Gadar-Ek Prem Katha.\" It is very sweeping statement to make, but I make it with conviction. The best movies are either fiction (Shawshank Redemption,) or portrayal of an event that left indelible scars and memories that is left for generations to cope. There were two people who put this masterpiece of a movie together, Anil Sharma and Nitin Keni, not necessarily popular names like Satyajit Ray and Raj Kapoor, but the sheer brilliance of the production, the reconstruction of the authenticity of the period, reminds me of David Lean production. It is difficult to relive part of the history that should be long forgotten, but to recreate this history is the genius of the director, in this case Anil Sharma. Sunny Deol, as (Tara Singh) is a performance of a life time for this actor whose talent has been under estimated and then we have Non Indian and idiot actors like Aamir Khan have been over estimated and put on a pedestal by morons of Mumbai media and these imbeciles for a cup of garam chai will worship anyone like pied pipers. Very few (Hrithik Roshan, Abishek Bachchan) can portray the raw emotions and bring a certain velocity to the character as Sunny Deol does here. He is matched by another thespian Amrish Puri, who is just an \"Volcano\" of talent. A new comer by the name of Amisha Patel, who gives a soulful, sobbing, stellar performance. She has subtlety and depth to her gaze and a femininity of emotion she brings to this character. Over-all, this is a masterpiece, that will be tough to be outdone.","imdb_rating":8,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" saga of love during partition","review":"it was an awesome movie. It's the biggest hit in the history if bollywood. Performances by SUNNY DEOL and amisha patel were excellent. This is the super duper hit of 2001.Everyone should go and see the movie. Over all the movie is excellent.","imdb_rating":10,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" Unbalanced!","review":"i found this film to be biased in its portrayal of the Partition and thus cannot agree that this one can give an insight to someone who has no clue of the events of 1947.Anil Sharma seems to have been boosting the ego of the Indian populace, or that section rather, which thinks they are so much better than their neighbor. Indeed, this film seems to suggest that the Sikhs (and by extension, perhaps the Hindus as well), are more benevolent compared to the evil Pakistanis who kill without question. then again, Tara saves Sakina only because he knew her from an earlier period and had developed feelings for her. For all its biasness, perhaps a silver lining is a scene where Sakina asks Tara why he saved her when he was out on a hunt for Muslims like the other men who were trying to capture her. On the whole, however, this film seems skewed at a time when other filmmakers are painstakingly trying to convey a notion of amity between the two warring countries.one such film is Dr Chandraprakash Dwivedi's film, Pinjar (2003). this film gives a more balanced perspective of the partition and suggests that the blame cannot be pushed to just one actor. if one needs to get a better understanding of this cataclysmic event, watch Pinjar. if one prefers to rejoice in bashing the Pakistanis for being \"evil\", then Gadar is something for you. But do not for one moment think that this is the story to believe. It is only a biased account which seeks to poison minds more than mend ties between people who never knew what was coming their way when they bought the national interests of their leaders.","imdb_rating":0,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" Amazing, cheesy at times","review":"I am a total sucker for movies like these. Absolutely phenomenal, with the right amount of comedy and emotions. The movie not only shows brief history about what exactly occurred, but also has an element of romance and love. Sunny Deoul is one of my favorite actors, and he is pretty good in this movie. One of the reason I watched this movie was because I was very interested about the history behind the separation of Pakistan from India. Although I will need to watch some documentaries to get an accurate picture, this movie showed the brutalities and struggles that occurred. In conclusion, if you like romantic films (as all bollywood movies are), this is a great movie. I would also recommend watching kabhi khushi kabhi gum.","imdb_rating":9,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" excellent movie ,a anil sharma masterpiece","review":"Gadar is a epic ,action-romantic + patriotic movie and no doubt best performance of sunny deol.Ameesha patel also at his best.Soundtrack is also melodious and great.No other movie can ever surpass this piece of art ever or forever. 1.I don't give any movie above 8 rating easily but for this i gave 10/10.","imdb_rating":10,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" Outstanding Mind blowing Blockbuster","review":"A milestone movie of Hindi Cinema ... such movies are made once in a life time .. brilliantly directed and superb acting by all the artists... scenes between Sunny Deol and Amrish sir are outstanding.. also brilliant music all songs mind blowing.\nAn all time Blockbuster.

Directed by Anil Sharma, who prefers making period related movie gives a rubbish movie. The songs were boring and ain't the kind of song you want to listen to in your car, full volume. Sunny Deol is famous for making daft movies, where he beats up a 100 bad guys on his own. He even kicks a metal jail door (Indian) and kicks a moving car far away (Teesri Aankh). I can give another 50 examples of disgraceful action by Sunny Deol. But I'm sure most people know this already. Sunny gives a pathetic performance once again repeating the same type of role. A guy claiming to be fighting for his countries piece, by using violence. Amisha Patel is hands down dead sexy with an amazing body that i would love to bone. But even she couldn't save the film from being a disaster. Instead of wearing sexy clothes like she usually does, in this movie she doesn't. Maybe cos she was playing a Muslim, but she doesn't act like one in the movie. Overall, this is a poor show all the way, I'm sure it will appeal to some people, who love seeing the Bollywood actor beat up 100 guys. Give me a break.","imdb_rating":1,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" Good movie but overrated","review":"The film is a big blockbuster and was Amisha's 2nd blockbuster after her debut KNPHThe film depicts the partition period but more on the love story actually and also mixes Sunny standard dishoom dishoom and anti Pakistani dialoguesThe film has several good emotional scenes and also the escape of Sunny- Amisha and the kid is well handled but there are too many loud and OTT scenes and Sunny removing a handpump and bashing 20000 goons at once or making people run away just with a shout The film also takes too many cinematic liberties like many scenes don't look like a period film and too modern In fact one doesn't feel they r watching a period film many times Also the KEY SERA SERA song was actually composed in 1956(the film depicts 1947) The climax is clichÃ©d and too prolonged Direction by Anil Sharma is good Music is goodSunny does his role in his own style but is superb in emotional scenes which he was criticised before Amisha is too good in her part though at times her voice is a problem Amrish Puri does his usual villainy act but leaves a mark Vivek Shauq is decent , Lilette Dubey is good so are the rest","imdb_rating":6,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" Like i said, Indian cinema actors r super heroes man.

In response, Sikhs and Hindus react by killing Muslims migrating to Pakistan from India. During the Hindu-Muslim riots that erupted soon after the Partition, Tara recognizes Sakina from the little Taj Mahal antique in her hands.
