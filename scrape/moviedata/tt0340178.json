Sunny Deol rocks in action, and he does not even roar in this movie. This movie has a major twist, and the thrills that follow and end with a brilliant train climax save the film. I love seeing Sunny terminating the terrorists as a true patriot. Basically, this is a good 2nd half action movie, as the action comes late. There are a couple of big surprises in this movie (Watch this film with an open mind, and you will come to know the real story here). Anyways, this is a good time pass.

For a change he doesnt shout patriotic dialogues. Not a great film in any meaning of the word but better than \"The Hero\"Most of the stunts are copied from one English movie or another but then isnt that a routine with our movies. Atleast, they are well executed.
