Shahkaal says - Give the man a hand","review":"With his first film in 2 whole years - Dev Anand tackles the complex social problem of love in Times Square. Ever watchful, he titles the film Love AT Times Square and the use of the uplifting AT instead of base IN sets the note for an experience of a lifetime.Dev plays the pivotal and complex role of a widowed NRI billionaire whose young daughter has two suitors - one a yuppie IT whiz and the other a poor immigrant. She meets both suitors IN Times Square and is wooed by them both, and will pick one of them as her true love AT Time Square on new years eve - in the shadow of Dick Clark's giant ball.Remarkably, the challenging role of the daughter is played by Heenee - possibly the first Dev find to be repeated in a Dev movie since Tina Munim - how special is that? Pouring all that she has into the role, Heenee outdoes her work in the formidable Dev masterpiece \"Censor\", and steals every heart including two lonely hearts AT Times Square. Who will win her heart AT Times Square? Will Dev get the girl as usual?However, in a daring sub-plot, an exotic new Dev find named Sia plays the leader of a local girl band who develops a crush on 80-year old evergreen hero Dev - a Svengali to this merry band of young women - even as she sings thinly veiled odes to her love for him, violently playing a giant cello placed strategically between her comely thighs. How will this doomed romance end - will it be like that awful film with Richard Gere and Winona Ryder? Stunned fans ask - has the maestro slowed down given us a simple love story instead of an extraordinary hard-hitting critique of society - as he is prone to do? Is this Dev's \"One from the Heart\", his \"Harvest Moon\", his \"Million Dollar Baby\" ...you get the drift, right? Thankfully not...Dev has some aces up his sleeve - surprisingly due to Osama Bin Laden and his band of evil-doers. As it turns out, the 9-11 tragedy took place while Dev was editing this film. Shaken by these events, Dev inter cuts some grainy CNN style footage of the attacks with footage of him looking out of a window. This montage of events is astonishingly effective - the viewer is convinced that Dev indeed did witness these events and has donated zillions to bail out New York. Take that Osama and what a mighty good man you are Dev Anand! Is that all, you ask? Not quite...Dev has one more ace up his buttoned down long sleeve. As we mentioned, Dev is a widower and in a heartrending flashback we learn that he has lost his beloved wife, Moon Moon Sen, in a horrifying plane crash. In a poignant moment, he searches for her after the crash - staggering around in a burning-field-in-the-dark set, calling out her name in vain until he spots her wedding ring on the finger of a victim. He takes her hand quite literally - only to find that it is attached to an amputated arm - presumably all that is left of her corporeal body! This is the capstone of a directorial career built on a deep and intimate understanding of the human condition by this unrelenting artist. After all, the auteur seems to ask us - in the end, what are you but a body attached to an arm? In one fell swoop, Dev renders all other things irrelevant and transcends film and enters the realm of eternity. Thank you, O Maestro, for this mind expanding and deeply personal film. Shahkaal highly recommends this film to one and all, and recommends that you watch it on the big screen - even if you have to buy one for this very purpose!","imdb_rating":10,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" Worse movie ever","review":"This movie has to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The story is so bad and uninteresting, acting is terrible by all the actors including the senile Dev Anand, dialogues are so bad that it makes your stomach upset. While I was watching this pathetic movie, I began to laugh so much about the bad acting and dialogues. Dev Anand has really lost his touch and his senses. Believe it or not but this movie has a double flashback which I have never seen. The double flashback means that while the actress tells story thru flash back, her father tell her story thru her flashback. Incredible!!!...DO NOT SEE this movie unless you want to see and have fun laughing at stupid acting and dialogues.","imdb_rating":0,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" a farce","review":"gday...what can i say about love at times square......words dont really express how vile this film is. The acting the story, the tackiness ...it made hum aapke hai kaun look like salaam bombay...it really was that tacky i mean with lines like \"sweety??...yes daddy?? i love you sweety??\" i mean where on earth does that happen...not even on seventh heaven.. You know Indian films really are becoming more and more pathetic...love at times square is just ahead of its time....i have a feeling worst has yet 2 come....-n-","imdb_rating":1,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" Critics are wrong about this well made movie","review":"Critics simply trashed this movie but the truth is that this movie provides a lot of entertainment. Critics were only right about the acting of the actors but still the movie is good. The storyline is like this The film features relatively new actors in leading roles namely Shoeb Khan, Chaitanya Chaudhary and Heene Kaushik. Dev Anand also sharpens his skills of acting in the film, as he does not leave any chance of appearing fully in each and every film of him. And also he loves to face the camera which is why he is seen everywhere in his films. Love At Times Square has been shot in the US in various areas, including Times Square, N.Y. The story of the film revolves around two young guys (Shoeb Khan and Chaitanya Chaudhary), one girl (Heene Kaushik) and a father of the girl (Dev Anand).\nSweety (Heene) is the daughter of a billionaire Indian (Dev Anand). The girl's father organizes a musical concert at Times Square where she comes across two young boys Raj (Shoeb Khan) and Bobby (Chaitanya Chaudhary). Raj is a computer engineer and works in the Silicon Valley whereas Bobby, who is a middle class person, has come to the US in order to earn a bright future. Sweety (Heene) is pursuing her studies in Mass Communication in the US. Both the boys fall in love with the same girl (Sweety). Watch it My rating 9/10","imdb_rating":0,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" gah...","review":"i cant believe i wasted money to watch this movie. the only reason i rented it was because i had heard that salman khan was acting in it. little did i know that it was a special appearance in one song, ONE. a very bad song as well. this movie is full of cliches and bad acting. its soooooo bad you get depressed and sick to your stomach just by watching it. so im warning all of you ....DONT WATCH IT!","imdb_rating":0,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0}],"imdbId":"tt0345594"}
