It shows how bringing youth into an industry is always a good thing. Just compare this film with Yaadein, from Bollywood veteran Subash Ghai.Where as Yaadein is probably one of the worst things to come out of a camera, DCH is one the best. It's just one of those films you'll find hard not to like, basically because it's exactly how the medium of Indian films should be used.Rather than just cut and paste a song into the film, the filmmakers have done very well to make each song feel wanted, visually interesting, and they never drag. The result is a near 3hr film that just flies by. Comedy, Drama, Great Songs, love stories that work, and some truly excellent casting. Everyone carries the film, and the 3 guys, Safi, Akshay and Aamir are too good together!Hopefully this film is a wake up call to the rest of Bollywood, who seem to be obsessed with unoriginality. Technically DCH can easily stand up against anything from the West. Editing, Directing, Cinematography, lighting, set design -- everything just works so well.Sometimes Bollywood can produce some truly great films, and this is most definately one of them!! You must watch it.","imdb_rating":0,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" AAMIR- the best actor in bollywood","review":"Without a doubt this movie is probably the best coming of age flick around, it has terrific acting and an incredibly touching plot that keeps you going throughout the whole film. I think the reason I love this film so much is because, everyone in some way could relate to it. When you're a pre-teen and have a close group of friends and face something so intense together, there's that special bond that no matter how much you loose touch with each other, one day, you just think of them and that one incident. The acting is just phenomenal. All-star cast. All-good film. The story is great - plenty of laughs to be had here, with sad moments, too. The acting is A-Grade","imdb_rating":10,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" the most realistic depiction of Indian youth in Bollywood","review":"After a string of Bollywood stinkers, this film was a breath of fresh air! Upon first glance, it might seem like the story has been rehashed from the plotlines of several other Indian films. But the presentation blew me away! Yes, I agree that Dil Chahta Hai has been heavily influenced by the Hollywood style of filmmaking. But it still retains the same passion and romanticism that has become a Bollywood staple ever since the beginning, thus making DCH a thousand times better than other \"Hollywood-wannabees\".Another thing that you might notice while watching the film is that there is not much of a plot. It just... floats along. But that's what makes it great; you never know where the next scene might lead you. What ties the story together is the bond of friendship shared by the three main leads. All the performances were terrific, especially Aamir Khan, who is probably the most respected actor of his generation.Ultimately, what's great about the film is that it connects to the youth. The depiction of youth is so dead-on and realistic that you would be disgusted at the way youth is treated in other Bollywood films, where every college student aside from the hero/heroine are party-going idiots or jittery nerds! In DCH, however, the people talk like how they're supposed to talk, and nothing seems unrealistic about their personality. While watching the film, it becomes quite evident that Farhan Akhtar belongs to a breed of young, talented directors. What they lack in experience, they make up with an ambitious vision and raw talent.If you haven't seen the film yet, go watch it. You'll be surprised at how much hope is still left in Bollywood.","imdb_rating":10,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" Dil Chahta Hai - most appropriate title","review":"This movie was released in the year 2001, the time when bollywood seemed to be in doldrums, producing one trash after another, the same year when another masterpiece \"Lagaan\" was released from bollywood and the year I finished my college and entered my first job and wow what an experience - it was just like a fresh breath of air.The first movie by an unknown young guy Farhan Akhtar (may be known earlier because of his famous parents Javed Akhtar - lyricist in this movie - and Honey Irani) and what a fantastic job he did both in direction and script writing. For me, he did a great job by experimenting with a novel idea, moving away from the well established norms of the bollywood industry and not presenting yet again melodramatic bollywood plot.The story revolves around three friends (supposedy born to very rich parents) - their relationship and their personal lifes - the guys with totally different natures and with their different meaning of life. However, the only thing that keeps them ever together is their never ending friendship.The story is not so great, doesn't convey any specific message but it keeps you glued and is refreshing as many times you watch it. In fact, many of the college going Indian youth (and even from other countries) would be able to relate themselves with the three main movie protagonists.All the actors have given very good performance. Aamir Khan simply reaffirmed his talent. He plays a prankster, who has knack of turning every thing into funny and the one who doesn't believe in the institution of love, but ultimately falls for it. For Saif Ali Khan this movie may even be called his re-birth. He plays a character who falls for every other girl, but is unable to express it when he really starts loving the one. Akhshay Khanna playing a bit mature and serious character may have seemed slightly weaker than the other two, but he played his character very well. This guy has a very different meaning for love and falls for an older woman. Preity Zinta looks amazing (as always) with an all different hair style. Sonali Kulkarni didn't seem so much at ease with the commercial cinema, but then too gave pretty good performance.Music by Shankar-Eshaan-Loy combination was also refreshing and different from all that mushy mushy Hindi film music. The great thing about songs that they didn't break the movie rhythm and seemed more to be part of the movie's story.In all, a must watch movie.","imdb_rating":9,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" Bollywood 2.0","review":"Less is more in Farhan Akhtar's 'Dil Chahta Hai'. Strip away melodramatic plots which always drag on longer than they are supposed to. Get rid of unbelievable protagonists who have all the answers and can fight off a horde of villains. Have no 'villains' to speak of, with the exception of the dude engaged to the girl you fancy, who acts like a bit of a prick.Build a story about the people you spend most of the time with - your friends, your dawgs, your posse, and ponder how you guys are going to sort out the really important things in your life. Like falling in love. Cracking on your friend who seems to fall for every girl he sees. Or your sensitive friend Sid who is in love with a much older woman - is he crazy? Wince as two of your best friends get into a very heated argument which splits them up and wonder what you will do now that you're caught in the middle. Hope for love and friendship to find a way through to reconciliation.Make a smart movie, without elaborate dance pieces set to a sweet soundtrack that remains in the top 10 a year after the film's release. In fact have a song that parodies the 'running around trees' segment that every other Hindi film since the 1950s has had and that the guys at school used to kid about. I mean, guys don't express their love for girls that way! Keep out guns, drugs, politics, strife, and family melodrama. Lace up your script with generous doses of humor which brings to light the hereunto underused Saif Ali Khan. Finally make sure the 'heroes' have shown some growth at the end of it. Of course it's been done to death in LA. That it could have been done so well in Mumbai is the astonishing thing.Finally, make reality cool again. Whatever your heroes wear, however they cut their hair, right down to the way they interact has to be believable. Make short hair and a goatee beard the national craze amongst guys. Put some real thought into color coding and matching outfits and give a laid-back style to the proceedings.Welcome \"Dil Chahta Hai\". The film that has had the largest influence of the look and hopefully the story of the biggest Bollywood films to follow it. A film that many people have been able to relate to. It seemed so obvious until Farhan Akhtar did it. Now watch how his ideas permeate through Bollywood.Here's looking forward to \"Don\" in 2006.","imdb_rating":10,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" Dil Chata Hai - What the Heart Desires","review":"I am not a fan on Hindi movies at all, but since I decided to study in India, learn a little Hindi and whatever else, I have expanded my Hindi film repertoire from just Lagaan and Amar Prem to include Dil Chata Hai.The story is simple Â at first, and is largely interspersed with a lot of English. Even I could understand the story without any subtitles. (Although you might turn it on for intense moments of extreme speed Hindi) Three spoilt rich best friends grow up, and in doing so, learn that their relationships between themselves, women and their families becomes tense as they mature and travel.\"What the Heart Wants\" is a sort of theme that persists throughout the film. One friend is stuck to a girl he cannot get, another to an older woman, and the last one is just struggling with many girls he cannot choose between. For a Hindi film, the dance-music numbers are not terrible (but of course not great) and the music without the dance is quite nice, with a lot of meaning attached to it. So after a major fallout they realize many things separately, and learn about their own relationship in turn.I recommend this film to anyone as a primer to Bollywood films Â I know I used it as one. High marks for this film since it beat the Bollywood standard of being completely incoherent and inane, although still sticking to the three plus hours.\"Can what the Heart Want be controlled?\" RATING: 9/10","imdb_rating":9,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" Well worth the time it takes to watch","review":"Indian movies tend to have a reputation for (a) being musicals and (b) having overmodulated, distorted sound tracks, as if everyone was singing and playing through a guitar fuzzbox. Fuzz is fine in its place (heavy metal rock music, for example) but a surfeit of it can readily wear down the listener.Dil Chahta Hai is a welcome breath of fresh air in the genre. It does have musical numbers but they're very pleasant on the ear, as is the sound track in general - modern musical styles, in some cases mixed with more traditional musical instruments (even a didgeridoo, the presence of which is explained below).I have an absolute hatred of musicals so for me to find this movie likable it really has to be something special. The awards it has already won demonstrate that it IS something special.The storyline is a little convoluted (which may explain why it takes 3 hours to run its course - around twice as long as its western counterparts, although Indian audiences may prefer the much longer format) but the acting is excellent throughout and the viewer is kept interested as the multiple interwoven plots twist and turn.This movie demands concentration though, to get the whole picture. There is a good deal of spoken English mixed with Hindi, so the subtitles are a must for those who don't understand Hindi, but the English speech is not often mirrored in the subtitles, so one must both listen carefully and watch carefully in order not to miss a beat.The subtitles themselves are not perfect, using unusual punctuation at times to emphasize a point (a word bracketed by a plus or minus symbol on one side and a two thirds fraction on the other takes a little time to absorb, for example).But these are only minor niggles. This movie is richly textured and provides a visual a feast throughout, especially if, like me, you are not familiar with the sights and sounds of places like Bombay and Goa. A good part of the movie is also set in Sydney, Australia, providing plenty of material to keep the interest going (and hence the presence of the aboriginal instrument noted earlier).This is very much a westernised production, with characters and behaviours that are possibly harder for traditional Indian audiences to identify with; I had no difficulty though with identifying with the three main male characters - three guys who are firm friends and have been for some years, and who may separate but somehow always manage to come back together when circumstances demand it. This kind of theme is pretty universal - the British TV series \"Last of the Summer Wine\" operates along pretty much the same lines, albeit fifty years on.One of the themes is the conflict between traditionalist parents and modernist offspring (in particular the arranged marriage) and the author leaves the audience to make up their own mind about which is \"right\", but maybe with a slight nudge in the direction of the traditionalists.The only gripe I have is with the choice of the anglicised title \"Do Your Thing\" for the US market. I think that totally misses the point of the movie. From the subtitles, Dil Chahta Hai translates as \"The heart wants...\", which would be more accurately and pertinently translated as \"What The Heart Wants...\".In other words, the storyline is more about following your heart in love than it is about leading a self-indulgent life (which, obviously, these characters do most of the time - courtesy of being very well off and generally able to please themselves what they do; not quite the little rich kids, but verging on it).This movie is that rare beast, a guy flick that is also a chick flick. Guys will enjoy watching it for the macho moments, girls will enjoy it for the soulful scenes (and the fact that the women generally behave with more maturity than the guys) and the weepy bits.All in all a very enjoyable, watchable movie. If this is a new direction for the so-called Bollywood cinema, then it is very welcome and I would like to see more of the same.As a professional writer I'd even be interested in contributing to that new direction...","imdb_rating":0,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" An Excellent movie with real life situations!!!","review":"Dil Chahta Hai Starring: Aamir Khan, Saif Ali Khan, Akshaye Khanna, Preity Zinta, Sonali Kulkarni, Dimple Kapadia and Ayub Khan Director: Farhan Akhtar Music: Shankar-Eshan-Loy Released. Debutant director Farhan Akhtar's (son of Javed Akhtar and Honey Irani) Dil Chahta Hai is the story of three friends and their respective thinking of love. It has a new, trendy and youthful look, completely different from the standards norms of the Bollywood film.Akash (Aamir Khan), Sameer (Saif Ali Khan) and Siddharth aka Sid (Akshaye Khanna), three close friends, have completed their education and are on the threshold of life. Akash does not believe in love. He is a flirt and his love affairs do not last for more than a month. Sameer believes in love. He is always carrying his heart on his palm and falling in love every time. But he still has not found that special girl. Sid, a painter, is the most sensitive and mature among the three. He knows the true meaning of love. He finds love in everything, everywhere and everytime.All three are enjoying life. Then comes the twist when Sid falls in love with older woman Tara Jaiswal (Dimple Kapadia), an interior designer, who is a divorcee. Akash is not able to understand the depth of Sid's love and hurts his sentiments for which Sid slaps Akash, thus creating a rfit between the two friends. Sameer tries to bridge the gap but is unsuccessful.\nSid leaves for a painting workshop at Kaushali. Akash leaves for Australia for his dad's business. On the flight, he meets Shalini (Preity Zinta), who he had briefly known earlier. Their friendship slowly blossoms into love. Meanwhile Sameer also finds his special girl in Pooja (Sonali Kulkarni), whom he wants to marry. Time has passed. All three friends are again in the same town -- but things are different for them now.Full marks to director Farhan Akhtar for giving a completely new and fresh look to the film in his debut film. The storyline is different from the run-of-the-mill fares which we are used to seeing for such a long time. Farhan is a welcomed entry in the list of talented and young directors. He has also dared to be different. He has taken care of the minutest details in the film. Technically, the film is no way behind some of the best Hollywood movies.Now the performances -- all the three leads are fabulous. They all fit their roles to a T. Aamir Khan as expected is the best. He is too good in the comic scenes and is excellent in the emotional scenes also -- especially in the scene when he breaks down on the phone while talking to his father. He definitely is the best among the current lot who does his work with precision and utmost dedication. Saif Ali Khan is a wonderful surprise in this film. This is his career-best role and one cannot imagine anyone else playing Sameer's role. His sense of timing and facial expressions are very natural and makes Sameer a very adorable character in the film.The least significant role was of Sameer but Saif made it very important. Now comes the final winner -- Akshaye Khanna. An actor-par excellence and very natural in front of the camera, Akshaye has played the role of Sid to perfection. His emotions and expressive face say a lot. He has given a spell-binding performance. Preity looks great in her new look and has acted well. Sonali Kulkarni is wasted and Dimple Kapadia still looks gorgeous and plays her role well.Music and the picturisation of the songs flow with the mood of the film. The locales of Sydney and Goa have been brilliantly shot. The first half of the film has some of the light good moments. The second half is filled with emotion though the Aamir-Preity affair has been stretched a lot thus making the film a bit lengthy.

The three lead actors are gorgeous - so it hardly matters that they must be the oldest students in town. The cinematography is beautiful - especially in the Australian sequences. The song and dance routines are as welcome as they are surprising.As with all Hindi films, it is pure melodrama of course. The ability to suspend one's disbelief is a necessity. But that aside, it has all the attributes of a good old fashioned Hollywood romance. Boy meets girl, boy loses girl... etc., times three.The core theme of friendship is a delight - as are the subtle homo-erotic overtones of Akash and Sid's relationship. Intended or not, I wouldn't have minded if they'd ended up together - but this is Bollywood remember!All in all, fantastic fun which I plan to watch again and again. Highly recommended.","imdb_rating":10,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" Beginning of a new generation of Bollywood films","review":"Before getting into the details, I must admit that this is certainly one of the best and most entertaining films I have ever seen!RATING: ****1/2 out of *****Plot ---- The story is about three very good friends and their relationships with each other. Aamir Khan plays a sociable and mischievous Akash, Saif Ali Khan plays a confused, often 'love-struck' Sameer and Akshaye Khanna plays a mature, confident Siddharth or Sid. Preity Zinta plays Shalini - Akash's love interest, though throughout the film Akash claims that he does not believe in love. Sonali Kulkarni plays Pooja with whom Sameer finally (really) falls in love and Dimple Kapadia is Tara Jaiswal, a divorced middle-aged alcholic. Thats all one needs to know about the film because right from the first reel the viewer is absorbed into the story and learns about each character.Review ------ Full credit must go to the director Farhan Akhtar who has broken many of the Bollywood production norms in order to make a technically perfect and enjoyable film. It would be unfair to call Aamir Khan the life of the DCH though his popularity in India and abroad would have drawn a substantial part of the film's audience. He gives a brilliant performance as usual as Akash. His scenes with Akshaye Khanna and some scenes shot in Australia (Opera, phone call to Sid, etc) are mind-blowing! SAif Ali Khan is the surprise packet of Dil Chahta Hai and there is a lot of untapped talent in him especially where comedy roles are concerned. But I felt that the best performance came from Akshaye Khanna who plays the character of Sid to perfection. His mannerisms, thinking, behaviour is very authentic and makes us all identify with his character closely. Preity Zinta looks gorgeous and is her usual chirpy self. Sonali Kulkarni could have certainly looked better without all that makeup. Dimple Kapadia shows how a good role can bring out an elegant performance from a seasoned actress.The best aspect of Dil Chahta Hai other than the actors' performances was the music. This is hopefully the start of more non-run of the mill compositions in Bollywood. Ofcourse, I hope for a lot more compositions like these from the music directors Shankar-Eshaan-Loy. The title song was the best and gels really well with this trndy film. Other good songs are 'Jaane Kyon', 'Kaise HAi yeh Rut' and 'Tanhayee'. 'Woh ladki hai  kahan' - a parody of old Hindi songs is simply hillarious. The lyrics provided by the director's father, veteran Javed Akhtar are simply amazing and complement the story of the film to perfection!Overall, a very entertaining feature and I hope to see more films like these in the near future. Three cheers to Farhan Akhtar and his team!!!","imdb_rating":10,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" One good story (that was not developed properly), one bad story and one no story","review":"The Akshaye Khanna/Dimple Kapadia story was fresh, as far as I can see. I do not remember a hero falling in love with an older woman in Bollywood. (The Assamese movie, Brishti, handled this issue way back in 1974; but that was an 'Art' movie.) If properly developed, it could have been a nice 90 minute movie, based on this segment alone.However, it was ruined by the million-times recycled Amir Khan story, not to mention the non-story of Saif Ali Khan. There is absolutely nothing new about the Amir Khan segment; no, actually the Opera was new! That segment is absurd; in real life that does not happen. And if it does, it is as rare as the life-style led by our heroes, at least in real life of real people in real India.","imdb_rating":6,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" A lovely episode of three lives","review":"Just pitifully, we have lots and lots Hindi speaking people in town and they have been here for a very long time, still the local Chinese don't really care to know their culture, let alone watch good Indian movies.  Perhaps there are more viewers in Tibet, Yunnan of China.There are tons of \"come of age\" movies and this is a wonderful one, it's like a fresh air enters into a stuffy room when I was watching it.  Unlike the Hollywood or Euro films, the difficulties that the three young men encounter are not presented in a realistic and sometimes brutal way but highly musical and artistic way.  Besides the stunning length, this is another feature of Indian movies.The boys are from middle class families, obviously, or even higher society. They have time and money to go to Goa to spend their holiday, go to chic places to spend their past time, have nothing to worry.  Just like any well-to-do Asian families, (I mean those in Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Korea, Japan....) the old man of the family would send their children to their own overseas company to receive \"wilderness training\" so that later they can take over the family business.  Akash just cannot escape this and stays in Sydney.Once again, the songs, the dances, the plot and the script are all marvellously put together.  Who is able to resist pretty and young faces, right?  Who wants to see the real McCoy of the true India?  Movie is always a dream.   Let's continue itBollywood is ushering itself into the world stage but it is still not a strong counterpart to Hollywood.  There are many good Indian people people behind the scene of many big movies, directors, editors, script writers.... Yet, I am just wondering it would take how many years for the mainstream (like Hollywood) center to \"digest\" Indians after taking in Chinese like Jacky Chan, Jet Li, Chow Yun-fat, Tony Leung.  Through Hollywood, the Indians actors would be more widely known because it is a place to rocket people's name over one night.The 1994 Miss World Aishwarya Rai caused a frenzy in Cannes in 2002.  I hope some male \"Khan\" would do so somewhere in Oscar or Cannes again because they do deserve it.","imdb_rating":7,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" Western-style modern Bollywood","review":"Siddharth \"Sid\" Sinha is nervously waiting at the hospital for his love with a sick liver. The movie returns back to the days when Sid was best friends with Akash Malhotra and Sameer Mulchandani. This is a story of the labyrinth of their love lives ending with them growing apart in the present day.The characters party. They fall in love. They live modern lives. I don't want to sound ignorant but this is a very Western modern Bollywood movie. I do notice the high IMDb rating but I wonder if this broke some cultural barrier back in India. I don't know anything about that but I'm going to try to review this like any other Western movie.There is some bro acting going on here. I would prefer the opening first act to be only about the three friends by themselves. They need to establish their friendship as the opener. Their chemistry is the most important aspect of the movie. It's more important than the romances. They need to show that they're the drive-to-the-airport friends and even bury-a-dead-body friends. They need to open by explaining their friendship. Sometimes, movies do this by showing their first meetings. I don't feel that connection has been established.This is a long three hour movie. There is the regular Bollywood song-and-dance. It's still long even without the songs. I like the guys. They seem like really nice fun guys. The movie kinda works by hanging out with them. It's no masterpiece by any means.","imdb_rating":6,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" Thought-Provoking and Artistic.","review":"This was the second Bollywood film I saw, and it remains at the top. It is a very basic storyline, but with amazing depth. It is the story of three friends, just graduated from college. Akash does not believe in love, and seems to facy himself a player. Throughout the film, you can almost see through him... he is afraid of being hurt. Sameer wants nothing more than to love and be loved. However, he is just as foolish as Akash, as he throws himself at all the wrong girls. Siddharth is the shy one, who seems to comprehend the complexity of love. When he falls for an older woman, he brings a new aspect to the story: love is selfless and asks nothing in return. Throughout this movie, you see these three stories develop, causing the audience to wonder, 'What is love?' It has been hailed as a hip movie with modern clothes and hairstyles. While this is true, it is also a highly artistic movie that never misses a beat or an opportunity for depth. An actor once said that an actor should be a person who holds a mirror, so the audience can see themselves. I hardly think it possible to watch this movie without seeing a little bit of Akash's cynicism, Sameer's naivete, and Siddharth's willingness to fight for love in ourselves. This is a must-see not only for Bollywood fans, but for hopeless romantics and cynics alike. This one will make you think.","imdb_rating":10,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" A very fine and realistic depiction of modern urban India and its youth","review":"Farhan Akhtar's Dil Chahta Hai is a true example of cutting-edge cinema. It is a groundbreaking film in that it realistically portrays the life of Indian upper-class youth and shows the urban and modern India in the most precise way through the story of three close friends and their experiences. The characters are real and very easy to relate to, the dialogues are simple and genuine, the proceedings are dramatic yet realistic, and the film is extremely interesting and entertaining. The film is emotional, but it never goes over-the-top. Farhan Akhtar makes an impressive directorial debut. His excellent direction is aided by extraordinary music, brilliant cinematography, effective editing, fantastic city locations and some very impressive performances by the ensemble cast. The camaraderie between the three friends looks most real and believable. I can't recall any other Indian film I've seen before or after Dil Chahta Hai which portrayed true friendship as well as this one.Aamir Khan, though initially seems to be miscast in the role of the completely cynical womaniser Akash, demonstrates a very fine versatility in this role and successfully shows the gradual growth in his character with depth and humour. Saif Ali Khan, in his best performance up until that point, is just brilliant as the insecure and very kindhearted Sameer. He displays confusion and fear with great conviction and a fantastic pinch of comedy. Akshaye Khanna is outstanding in this wonderful dramatic role of a serious and sensitive guy who falls for a woman much ahead of his age. Preity Zinta is marvelous as Shalini and skillfully sensitises her character. She plays the part with grace and restraint, and her inner feelings are perfectly understood thanks to her expressive eyes. Dimple Kapadia adds another accomplished performance to her vast repertoire. Sonali Kulkarni's real talent is unfortunately wasted, though she does try to do the best of what she is given.Overall, Dil Chahta Hai is a remarkable picture about life, and it should provide a great deal of quality entertainment to each and every viewer, whoever and wherever he is. A great film which is according to me the best Hindi film of 2001.","imdb_rating":9,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" Another classic","review":"I started watching the IMDb top 250 a couple of years ago after I finished the AFI top 100 list of everything they had. One of the most pleasant surprises was my introduction to films from India. I don't believe they know how to make a bad film. This is another 10/10. I get so wrapped up in this movie. The lack of understanding the language is never felt. The actors do such a great job you may not understand the words but you feel the emotion and it seems like you are right there. I laughed out loud and cried like a small child. What a great story with great actors. Aamir Khan is one of my new favorite actors. The man has skills and talent that many others can't even come close to touching. The music fits. We make fun of it over here in America but once I opened up my eyes and saw how well it helps to tell the story. Man we Americans can be so judgmental. I believe it is because no American studio can pull it off so they make fun of it out of jealousy. Aamir Khan provides another unbelievable performance. If he doesn't have a president for his fan club sign me up to do it. The man can flat out act.","imdb_rating":10,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" Childhood friends...","review":"\"Dil Chahta Hai\" is a comedy - drama movie in which we watch three childhood friends who they just finished college and nothing can be between them. Although everything is going to change when they fall in love and become very different people because of the way they approach their relationships. These situations will make things difficult for all of them and they will change their friendship too.I liked this movie because it combines very well comedy with drama and from this combination we can see and observe the true meaning of love either is erotic or is between friends. I also liked this movie because it shows us how things change when people fall in love, how their personalities change and how this influence them. Once more Aamir Khan's interpretation played as Akash Malhotra was very good but equally food were the interpretations of Saif Ali Khan's who played as Sameer and Akshaye Khanna's who played as Siddharth Sinha.Finally I have to say that \"Dil Chahta Hai\" is a very good movie to watch and if you like movies that show the influence of love into relationships and what are the results of this then this is your movie. I also believe that this movie makes us understand many things about it and wants to shows us how we have to behave in difficult situations that maybe will come up in our lives.","imdb_rating":7,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" breath of fresh air to Indian cinema","review":"when I first saw this movie,I was 11 and today it gives me immense pleasure to write a review on this.the movie marks the entry of one among bollywood giants FARHAN AKHTHAR as a director.the screenplay of this movie is so beautiful that one seldom feels bored,after watching this over 100 times.the movie has taken the film making to next level and this one was certainly a wake up call for all directors of bollywood. friendship is that special thing without which one cannot survive.the movie signifies the value of true friendship and full credits to all the characters for making movie much more effective!!there is no item song,action sequence,vulgar dialogues,and any such nowadays film strategy..the narration of friendship of two generations makes the movie stand apart..!the film bagged a national award.after watching this movie one truly craves for such friendship which is hard to find...the humor in this movie is an added flavour.I wonder how many books farhan would have referred to make such a good movie which is not possible for even younger generation directors...thank you farhan akhthar....i feel blessed to see movies like this..!","imdb_rating":10,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" HUGE disappointment!","review":"oh gosh, i had heard so much about this movie i was expecting something at least imaginative, at most mind-blowing! i don't know what annoyed me the most, oh wait, actually i do!

If you've never seen a Bollywood film before, this is the best place you could start.Akash (Aamir), Siddharth or Sid (Akshaye), and Sameer (Saif) are best friends. They are all different; Akash is very critical and a prankster, he believes that love doesn't last more than a couple of weeks. Sid is the most serious and mature of the three, he is a little shy and often disappears in his own world of painting. Sameer, is desperately romantic and \"falls in love\" a lot. Often this ends in heartbreak...Nevertheless, despite their differences, the trio have something in common: their love for each other. Soon, the three find their own lives dragging them forward, forced to leave the others behind, and they realize the value and seriousness of life. They discover many things along the way, like true love, and true friendship. When their lives collide again, their individual worlds are shaken up once more, leaving them with the support they really need: each other.Aamir gives a very fun-filled, suave performance, he is comical and the audience will always love him, its brilliant. Saif Ali Khan does an awesome job, it's comedy, but it's a very strong performance too. Akshaye Khanna, gets full credit for the best performance in this movie. Not only did he get the best role, but he played it to perfection, the fight scene with Akash, was brilliant. I give him my full applause. The pretty Preity Zinta, also gives a noteworthy performance. Her cute smile and charming personality light up the screen and makes the movie refreshing. Sonali Kulkarni gives a gritty performance. She is forgettable, but she does play the role well. Dimple Kapadia plays the depressed alcoholic mom easily. Ayub Khan, Rajat Kapoor, and Suhasini Mulay give small, but important roles.The music is amazing. Certainly the best part about the film.

It deals with the youth in India, the transitions they go through, their love lives and most of all, friendship. Farhan Akhtar is brilliant, and this will always be one of his master pieces, no matter how many movies he makes in the future. The movie starts with the present, with Dimple Kapadia being admitted in the hospital, and then a flashback sets in. Farhan Akhtar has created the characters of the three main protagonists with a lot attention to detail and thus, has created characters that the youth in India can relate to. The protagonists are not extra-ordinary heroes, nor are they spoilt brats. They are just normal young Indians with new ideas raised in affluent families. They have the right blend of traditions and modernity. The movie consists of a strong plot, good characters who are believable and yet, interesting. The songs of the movie are excellent too. The picturizations and script is great.
