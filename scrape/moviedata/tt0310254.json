Salman Khan is great as usual, and nothing more needs to be said about him. Dia Mirza is good in her role as is Sushmita Sen. Sharat Saxena and Rajpal Yadav are also good. It has something for everyone: romance (a lot), action ( a lot), humour (some) and good music. The story is great and is complemented by great action. The music is fabulous. Clearly, Sajid-Wajid have done a good job. The tracks 'Bindiya chamke','Mehndi hai lagi' and 'Yeh bekhudi'are the ones that stand out. The cinematography's good and so is the editing. Definitely Pankaj Parashar's best movie.Verdict: A must watch. I give it 9.5/10","imdb_rating":9,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" Much better than the 'Masala' blockbusters of today","review":"This movie came out when Salman Khan was in the news for all the wrong reasons- Aishwarya Rai break-up, the alleged hit-and-run case etc. In retrospect, all that must have contributed to its dismal performance at the ticket windows, for as a film, Tumko Na Bhool Paayenge, is a quite solid commercial potboiler. It has a good story to tell, some great songs, good looking actresses, and a lead actor in decent form. Inspired (though not copied) from a Hollywood flick, the movie even flirts with that much abused domain of the Mumbai underbelly, a trick that always tends to bring in critical acclaim. Had the first half been tighter and had the Jhonny Lever comic track done away with, the movie could have been at a different level altogether, competing with the best action thrillers of the Hindi film industry. In any case, even in its present form, TNBP is quite an entertaining watch. Tip: Just fast forward the initial bits and 2-3 songs. Though don't dare miss anything once Salman Khan moves back to the city to unravel his past.","imdb_rating":9,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" Popcorn stuff with unexpected depth","review":"The movie reminds me of a delicacy with a surprise element(and then what are thrillers for). This is one movie which keeps you engaged with its comical and romantic moments right from the start and puts you entirely at ease in the first half. For those who would be expecting a run of the mill romantic movie, avoid the second half and watch the end. For those who came expecting an action movie as the reviews may have it, the first half is boring and apparently pointless. But the suspense builds up slowly without crying out loud. And all elements in the first half are woven pretty well for the \"two halves\" to create a decent whole. What I found eye-catching was the way the two elements in the movie were combined. Arguably one of the better Indian movies.","imdb_rating":10,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" Kool action Film but has its own flaws ....","review":"Tumko Na Bhool Paayenge is straight out of The Long Kiss Goodnight but here the director has replaced the main character with a man.Veer (Salman Khan) is the only son of a Thakur and is the apple of his parent's eyes. Soon after his engagement to the village gal Muskan (Diya Mirza), he starts having strange visions of uniformed men chasing him and a ferocious dog attacking him. He and his family are perplexed. Is this case of reincarnation or hallucination, a long lost twin brother or amnesia.Veer goes to Mumbai to learn more about these visions but as soon as he arrives, he meets people calling him Ali; a woman named Mehak (Sushmita Sen) claiming to be his ex gal friend, a young guy calling him bhai(guy from bad side of society) and policemen chasing him.The first half of the film is a little too simple and long but the second half is fast-paced, slickly filmed and interesting. Action scenes are well choreographed and intelligently performed. The special effects in the flashback scenes are highlight of the film and those shots are executed with lots of style.However placements of songs looked forced, editing needed there to make it look more impact full. Dialogues b/w Salman Khan and Diya Mirza are bad. there seems to be no consistency in the dialect as it fluctuates b/w Rajesthani and Punjabi.Salman Khan leaves an impression in latter half of the film. while both ladies of the film i.e. Sushmita Sen and Diya Mirza look beautiful in their own ways. Recommended for action lovers.","imdb_rating":10,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" Action pack thriller and emotional drama","review":"This movie is one of the best thriller movie of Indian cinema history,i don't know why Indian people did injustice with this film even though it was a hit in UK.When i watched this movie i was amazed to see that how much interesting this movie is and i was thinking that it may going to be the best movie of the year and Salman khan will get the best actor award because his acting was awesome in this movie he gave the best acting of his life in this movie and i was very happy to see that but nothing happened in that way and i really got disappointed to see that i don't know what critic actually see are they blind or what i don't know!!........but really this movie is fun to watch and a great thriller as well.And if u guys want to see the best acting of Salman khan gotta watch this movie because i became his fan after i saw his acting in this movie so intense and so natural and emotional he deserved to get the best actor award for this movie but they didn't gave it to him i feel so sad for that.Anyway wholly Solly this movie is great enjoyment.","imdb_rating":10,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" One of Salmans Best. Wrong release date otherwise Blockbuster","review":"Tumko Naa Bhool Payenge is a amazing Thriller with a superb twist. I have seen thousands of films in Cinema. This is one of the best Salman films I've enjoyed, you get that real good atmosphere feeling in the cinema. It was a big HIT in UK, we appreciate good filmmaking. I was told it Flopped in India, because of religion (If you see the film, you will understand). Salman wears a Islamic Chain and a Hindu Chain together, there is a reason why he does this, doesn't mean you give the film a Flop, some critics will never learn. Plus i heard not many peolle saw it because of Salman being in trouble with the law during release which is a shame because its much better then most of his future big hits.\nAlthough, it was a LITTLE borrowed from Hollywood films Bourne Supremacy and Long Kiss Goodnight. This bollywood version is FAR BETTER in every way. I'm not gonna say, what the film is about, its Best if you see it yourself. The storyline may sound boring, but its not (This is a Movie Genius Review). Salman Khan delivers one of the Best performances of his life. The Very Sexy Sushmita Sen gives a good performance. Diya Mirza looks sexy as ever, kind of a Aishwarya look alike. Great Twist, and some nice songs. Forget some of the critics with no taste giving this a flop, I recommend this.","imdb_rating":10,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" Good Action movie","review":"This movie was so entertaining It was really enjoyable The action fighting scenes are very entertaining and worth watching Songs are really impressive salman is superb as the protagonist hero DIA is decent and the heroine excellent Inder Kumar is good as the villain Mukesh Rishi is superb Other cast were good in their respective roles Overall my own rating is nine out of ten","imdb_rating":9,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" Arguably, some of the best songs of the 2000's","review":"I won't comment much on the film except to say that it wasn't terrible but there was some obvious flaws and questionable acting in certain moments. However, I absolutely have to say that I still think the music in this movie was some of the best of recent years. A few of the songs were absolutely beautiful, hummable, and melodious and the album stands up as one of the best of the earlier 'noughties'. Unfortunately i think the film reception overshadowed what was arguably some great, great music which i still listen to now more than 5 years on!!!My rating of 9 is not for the movie but as you guessed it the gorgeous tunes. Definitely check out Yeh Bekhudi Deewangi, which was my favourite track!","imdb_rating":9,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" Worth it for some surprising twists and Salman Khan.","review":"TNBP was another post-2000 release in Salman's career that had a short venture at the box-office. Although the movie is not AS bad as its box-office fairing would say, but its hardly any great shakes either.TNBP can be broken down in two parts: 1) The first half shows Salman's dull life with his parents in a village where he visualizes weird things abt his past every now and then. 2) In the 2nd half u see Salman out in search to piece together who he used to be as he slowly gains his memory back.The pros to me were definitely the well directed action scenes that mostly involved Salman Khan - whose at his best when he's beating up the gundas here. Other positives were a couple of twists in the story that def. caught me by surprise and kept me interested till the very end. One thing is for sure, once the initial twist occurs b4 the intermission, TNBP will keep u glued to the screen till the end. Cons:Most of the first half is just plain boring cuz nothing happens other then some lame jokes and actors looking bad while trying to speak in their village's accent. The cinematography has a dry feel to it throughout which makes the mood of the film appear quite dull. U can obviously tell not a lot of money was spent on this movie. The songs only happen to be unnecessary stop gaps.Other then that, i would say TNBP is a decent movie that's worth a watch once for Salman's presence and some interesting twists in the storyline.","imdb_rating":7,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" He will not forget her, but this movie is forgettable","review":"When I first saw Tumko Na Bhool Paayenge I was surprised by what it presented. The title quite suggests a movie that is something on the lines of a romantic drama or something of this sort. But the film is not. It does have its romance and drama like every other Hindi movie, but more than anything it's an action thriller. The storyline is quite interesting and it's extremely twisted and unpredictable. But the movie itself does not really offer anything incredibly special and is overall a rather ordinary product, which, on top of that, is unoriginal. That's the case with most Hindi movies of its sort, and sadly so. The film has a stronger second half, but in the end, it does not make that great an impact. Salman Khan plays the leading role, and he does quite well. His role requires him to look confused, and he manages to look successfully awkward. Diya Mirza is pretty and likable. Sushmita Sen is okay in a relatively small role. Sharat Saxena is fine as the loving father. One song that Ireally liked is \"Yeh Bekhudi\" which is beautifully sung by Sonu Nigam and very well pictured on screen. Tumko Na Bhool Paayenge is a surprising but not particularly impressive film, but still it can be seen once.","imdb_rating":5,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" Never be able to forget you....","review":"I watched this before I watched Bourne Identity...But it is very good...this is coming from a anti-Salman Khan fan.The film is a rip-off of Bourne Identity but what did you expect from Bollywood.Veer continues to have nightmares which show incidents and places..something he has no idea about or what they mean. But when the nightmares become more continuous he pursues the places in his dreams and finds his past which is filled with betray and death..Salman's acting does improve a little in this movie...The actions were a little on going and Salman taking off his top was very odd...why? Does one have to take his top of when fighting...Or is that one of Mr.Khan's stipulations...The film is enjoyable nonetheless...","imdb_rating":7,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" Superb Film","review":"One of Salman Khan Best Films I really Love the Movie action Drama Romance too good","imdb_rating":9,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" ONE OF THE BEST MOVIE","review":"One of the best Salman Khan's film!

This movie will either impress you and you will remember it or you will not think of it at all. This is the first Bollywood movie I watched and I was 14. Movies are my life I worked for animation department and develop characters for games and movie and still I love this movie. This movie is more about emotional ride and some twist with riddles. I cannot convince you on the technicality of this movie. This means if you have not yet seen it then why not, try it. Watching this movie now will be challenging because it s more then a decade old. You have to lower your expectations and try to feel the 2000s era.","imdb_rating":0,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" Superb Film","review":"Superb Film Salman Khan Best Action Hero In Bollywood I love the Story","imdb_rating":9,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" Excellent.","review":"Good Direction.Good Acting.Good Screenplay.Good Songs.Village life is good.People are happy in open spaces.Liesure abounds.Thanks and Regards.Sam RupaniHouston, Texas, United States of America.","imdb_rating":10,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" Last kiss goodnight","review":"Salman Khan pre TERE NAAM and post 2000 did some crap films and was disinterested in those filmsThis is one of though decent yet could be better filmsThe first half is terrible, It is so sleep inducing and focus more on comedy and romanceThe twist when Salman realises his sickness keeps you interested and the interval point does strike youThe flashback and post that Salman's return to Mumbai is well handled and things keep you engrossed till the climax which though well handled is too clichédDirection by Pankaj Parashar is okay in parts but bad at places Music is good, most songs are niceAmongst actors Salman Khan does try hard to do justice to his part, but somehow he tends to look too disinterested in the film maybe his role is like that so it's okay, he is at his best in the latter part Sushmita is okay in her part, Dia is painful Inder is wooden, Sharat Saxena is good in his part Alok Nath is okay in his part Rajpal Yadav annoys, Johny Lever is too loud while the rest are okay","imdb_rating":3,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" Garbage","review":"This movie is an attempt at...well it's an attempt at something, I just can't figure out what that is.  Maybe the director set out to make a movie about a man trying to reconstruct his past , a la Memento, but he ended up making just another derivative Salman Khan movie.  The plot, if you care, is about a guy who can't remember his past and so, like any Indian hero, leaves his \"family\" in search of his true identity... The first hour has Salman trying to act.  The second hour has Salman breaking necks.  And the third hour has Salman breaking necks while trying to act.  This movie is inspired by the Hollywood film \"The Long Kiss Goodnight\" which wasn't much of a movie to begin with.  Performance wise, Sushmita Sen is the best which should give you an idea of the quality of the acting.  Salman continues to show his disinterest for his profession -- he never misses a chance to take off his shirt and display his deteriorating physique.  Diya Mirza still can't act whereas the guy who plays Inder is just a waste of space. The action sequences are just a cut-and-paste exercise and the story is interesting for about half an hour before it gets predicatble and slowly gets to its climax.  If you'ld like to waste three hours of your time - think Kabhie Khushi Kabhie Ghum - then you're in for a real treat. Otherwise rent something else.","imdb_rating":1,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0}],"imdbId":"tt0310254"}
