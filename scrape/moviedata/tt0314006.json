The film revolves around this young man and his daily family life which is shattered when a simple outing with his girlfriend (played by Diya Mirza) lands him on the most wanted list of a very corrupt police inspector whom Viveik's character attacks in defense of Diya's. His family and friends become a target as a battle of who's who ensues for the next one and a half hour of the film, in which there is a lot of heartbreak, bloodshed and tears and the audience is left at the edge of their seat to see who will emerge triumphant in this battle?
