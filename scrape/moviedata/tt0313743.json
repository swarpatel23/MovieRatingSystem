Suspense was super class and was very unlikely to be guessed. Nana Patekar acting was superb. All others were not very good though. But, the film is lifted mainly by NP. A truly unique thing about the movie was the ending. I haven't seen such justified and unusual ending in any other film. If this is not a copy of any Hollywood film then its gonna rest into my all time favorite movies. Watch the movie and you would not regret 1 bit of your time spent.9/10","imdb_rating":10,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" Suspense at the thrilling level!!","review":"This movie will horrify you esp. the married peoples. The storyline is best kept undisclosed. Just watch it and feel the suspense at every move of the movie. The movie if watched a second time will give you equal but a different level of entertainment. It can be watched more than single time. Nana patekar is just outstanding!. He will always be a legend in Indian film industry. Other performances are also well acted. Everything is fine except the \"justification\" of the plot. If you are a suspense lover this is a must watch!NOTE: This is not for children and definitely not for family-viewing","imdb_rating":8,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" Poor acting, script and screenplay lets down a potential masterpiece!","review":"I don't happen to be a big fan of Bollywood movies and rarely watch many. When I settled down to watch this movie, little did I know what was to come and that I would be writing a review of such an ordinary looking movie by the end.To start off, this is NOT just another typical Bollywood flick where you expect a lot of action, romantic songs or humor. Yes, Vadh lacks in all of them. It lacks even more. But a brilliant idea and an interesting plot makes up to a good extent recovering some of the movie's soul. However poor execution lets down what could've been a great thriller.The story revolves around a psychiatrist Dr Arjun Singh played by Nana Patekar and his much younger, and pregnant wife Joyti (Anupama Verma). They seem to be happily married. One day a patient of Dr Singh, a psychotic criminal, escapes from jail following a homicidal spree. While the police is after the madman on the run, the story takes several intriguing twists and turns. What unfolds may not be what you would have expected. If you decide to sit down and watch this movie, then don't let yourself fret out halfway through because the movie requires some patience and understanding from its views. And if you can just somehow ignore the very obvious bad aspects of the movie, you will enjoy it. It's worth the time.Where they have been a major hit in Hollywood for a long long time, Thrillers, particularly good ones, are rare in Bollywood. I never felt more gripped watching a modern Indian thriller since I watched Gupt. The movie has lots of shortcomings that can be noticed right from the beginning. The script is awful, songs very ordinary and the acting miserable! A more professional acting performance or a better cast altogether along with a well-written script would have made a huge difference. While the poor rating and lack of popularity reflects the flaws, there is also an opinion that the Bollywood audience is not mature enough yet to perceive such movies or perhaps it's just not their THING. if this were made in Hollywood, it would have been a super hit! I strongly wish to see a better remake of this movie made either in Bollywood or Hollywood, from a more competent team.7/10","imdb_rating":7,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" Not a very good movie","review":"I'd classify this as a B grade Indian movie, it really wasn't that good. The main characters are Dr Arjun, his wife Jyoti, his brother Vijay and his friend Aryan.The plot is as follows: Dr Arjun treats inmates at the local prison,one of whom is a dangerous serial killer of women. One day the serial killer escapes from prison. After this, two girlfriends of Aryan's die and Vijay begins to suspect him.There were no clues leading up to the ending within the movie, to let you know who the killer was. It wasn't very well written, and the songs were ordinary. Only see this film if you're a fan of one of the actors.","imdb_rating":0,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0}],"imdbId":"tt0313743"}
