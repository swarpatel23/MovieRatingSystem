The set up is the more boring, yet the more charming part of the film. It introduces us to the title character, a 5 year old boy called \"Rahul\" who lives with his father Akash (former model Jatin Greval). Those early minutes show us how much Akash loves his son - and how much that guy works out. The girls in the audiences will surely appreciate Greval's perfectly structured body but one starts wondering whether this is supposed to be a workout video or a movie. Well, anyway, there's one dance and song number in which we see Akash and his ex-wife Mira (Netha) fooling around on the beach and in the rain. It really pays of there that the two are so great looking. It borders on some sort of textile commercial, but it sure is pleasing to the eyes.The story continues and we learn that Akash and Mira are divorced. Akash tells Rahul that his mother was a very bad person and that's why they separated. The film doesn't reveal if this is the truth, though. Rahul of course decides one day that he wants to find out for himself. He looks for his mother, finds her and visits her without Akash knowing about it. She is not evil at all and tells her son the truth about the divorce.Now, the problems start. Not just for Rahul, but also for the film. One reason for that is that we now lose all emotional contact. Both parents are selfish and not fully likable. The other problem is the turnaround in Akash's character. It is unbelievable that the film now portrays him as some sort of minor bad guy, when before, we saw him caring for his boy and loving him with all his heart. The film wants us to believe, that a father alone cannot be enough for a child. Of course we all want that every child gets 2 parents, but sometimes, fate decides otherwise and single-parents try their very best to support their children. So does Akash. But the film wants to be conservative. It wants to promote marriage even if it means throwing the characters and the plot around.The ending is the most contrived in a series of contrived events. It's not terrible, but tiresome. Granted, you have to shed some tears at the end, but the film doesn't fully deserve it. Overall, I'd say you can watch it for good performances, some sexy scenes in the beginning and a story for the heart. But don't expect to be blown away. My rating:6/10","imdb_rating":6,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" Another traditional bollywood movie with good performance","review":"Although I don't comment on movies frequently but I found previous comment quite biased and illogical. This movies promotes general Indian opinion that marriage is a an institution that must not be broken and a child wants an umbrella of his both parents. A marvelous acting by the child. Its plot is pretty traditional one: Parents will get divorced, son will be very cute and finally son will be near death and parents will go to son and then son will get cured and parents get married. A happy ending :). Thus it is a well directed movie with traditional plot and some good songs but with good performance by actors and it will try to make you weep in the end. Particularly acting by the child is remarkable. I will give it 7/10.","imdb_rating":7,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" VERY BAD story which I very don't like","review":"The story is not so bad, but it's very nonsense and made me really feel not into it at all.Why? Mainly because I don't agree with this kind of plot. Let see, first his mother was a very bad mother. She was not taking care of her son and refused to see her son at the beginning when the film started. Second if the story was really happening in a real life maybe Rahul's parents will be separated forever but because this is a film so they made them going back together again. I think it's very difficult in a real life, if your husband or wive already broke your heart and never met you for years then both of you suddenly met then forgive each other (that is nonsense since the process of the reconciling was instant).The actor who was acting as Rahul is cute and funny. ANOTHER NONSENSE FILM!","imdb_rating":1,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0}],"imdbId":"tt0277981"}
