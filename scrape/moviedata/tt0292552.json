Little Touch of Morality with Enjoyment","review":"Ahathian is back second time as director after his previous success of Sirf Tum. Here Fardeen Khan plays as Rishi Oberoi, a spoiled-brat of a good and rich businessman father Mr. Oberoi (Suresh Oberoi). He likes to enjoy with drinking, money and spending every night with a new girl. But he is against the ideas of marriage and family settlement which he reasons out as burdens of an independent life. Suddenly he starts running after Chandni Gupta (newly introduced actress Reema Sen) when she wins in a beauty contest. After she joins his Rishi Technology company he unknowingly starts falling in love with her and his lifestyle goes on changing slowly. The movie has a good principle, i.e. \"wealth does not last long in a family with bad responsibility\". Fardeen's role also spread a good suggestion towards the young generation - \"enjoyment is good but it must have a limitation as it affects the family\". Hum Ho Gaye Aap Ke is well in technical, performances, story, music, casting but still it was poor in box-office. Undoubtedly this is one of Fardeen's best movie, as his role is a dream for every growing youth in the modern age. They dream modern life, enjoyment, load of money and finally run one after another girl. But all these finally result to a fully ruined life.","imdb_rating":8,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" Fantastic.....Heart warming fun","review":"Hum ho gaye apke is a romantic heartwarming movie.I think its one of Fardeen's finest movies. The south Indian actress Reema Sen was Marvellous. Reema Sen is Very Pretty and Sexy and id like to get naughty with her indeed. Its quite unfair that she doesn't make much Movies. What i liked best about this film is Fardeen's character, a drunk, heavy smoker and womaniser guy whom doesn't believe in love. The movie is literally about Fardeen and his life of women. He pays women for Pleasure until he has his eye for Reema. Reema refuses his offer. The story moves on to a dilemma, where Reema is left in the middle of the street alone. She cant go to her mothers house, and she has no where else to go. Fardeen offers her to stay at his house until she's settled. Thats when the romance blossoms. Great direction. The Music was brilliant. My Favourite song was Pehli Baar. This is a great attempt by Fardeen and highly recommended. Must See","imdb_rating":9,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" My type of movie :D","review":"If You're living a real player life just watch it ! I seriously just dont want to say anything more ok ? Just awesome movie with good as story line and songs : )","imdb_rating":10,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" Superb romantic film","review":"I am shocked at the low rating that this movie has received on IMDb. I suppose people did not give it a fair chance. The director (Ahathian) did not direct any movie after this, I wonder why. This film tugs at your heart strings, makes you want to cry and then fills up your heart with joy, warmth, hope and love. A must watch if you are a die hard romantic. The best part of the film is that the limited acting abilities of the lead actors do not succeed in overshadowing the terrific script! Yes this movie is awesome in spite of Fardeen and Reema! Imagine how good it is then! And the awesome songs, oh... let me go and listen to them once more now... I give it ten on ten.","imdb_rating":10,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" I like this flop and criticized movie","review":"Good guys. Bad guys. Good gals. Bad gals. Should the youths be categorized in such stereotypes ? To be fair - no. However the public opinion is expressed through stereotypes only which become labels for people. As we know, since a person's public image walks ahead of him, the virtues of a guy (or a gal) who has been labelled as a bad one, are ignored like anything. But the fact is, the personalities of real flesh and blood human-beings contain gray shades. A person labelled as good may do something bad and correspondingly, a person labelled as bad may prove his goodness when the time strikes.Hum Ho Gaye Aapke (I have become yours) is the story of Rishi (Fardeen Khan) who is the well-known brat of a business family containing only his father (Suresh Oberai). He is deprived of mother and sister. And hence he has learnt to see the girls as sex object only and treats every girl coming across him as 'available against generous consideration'. Besides, he is an alcoholic who drinks without caring for the time, the place and who is around him. According to his habit and character, he makes indecent proposal to Chaandni (Reema Sen) who is a middle class girl with a strong personality and high morals. She not only turns down his proposal but also rebukes him. Rishi takes it casually and forgets it under his 'you win some, you lose some' philosophy.However an employee in Rishi's company, Mohan (Apoorva Agnihotri) comes in contact with Chaandni and befriends him. Chaandni also likes his nature and they become good friends. Mohan becomes emotional about her. When Chaandni is engaged to someone else, Mohan sends her a letter through Rishi saying that he won't be able to live without her. Rishi takes this much pain because he considers Mohan his close friend, not just an employee in his concern. Chaandni feels it appropriate to respond to Mohan's sentiments who comes from a modest background and longs for true love of someone. Hence she runs away from her marriage and moves to Mohan's house alongwith Rishi. But she is taken aback to find that Mohan proves himself to be a coward. He bows before the pressure and emotional blackmail of his selfish and old-fashioned parents (who want to marry him somewhere else for the sake of dowry) and refuses to accept Chaandni in his life.Now Chaandni feels quite lonely and supportless in the world because now she cannot go back to her parental house also. Rishi offers her to move to his home and promises her decency and safety (from himself also). She feels that despite apparently being a brat, Rishi is not bad by heart. She trusts him and moves to his household where Rishi's father welcomes the unexpected guest with surprise. With her good behaviour, pleasant manners and kind-heartedness, she wins the hearts of all who come into her contact there. She joins Rishi's office also and as she is able to locate the virtues in Rishi's personality, she not only gets closer to him but also becomes successful in transforming his personality (after understanding the reason behind his spoilage). Mohan tries to be close to her again but she keeps him at bay (though forgives him).Rishi's father comes to know that his son has started loving Chaandni but he hurts Chaandni's self-respect by indicating to her that she is a gold-digger and trapped Rishi in her love for the sake of her social and monetary security. She gets out of Rishi's house and life only to be reunited with him in the end.The movie is an emotional one and underscores the importance of company. Not only a man is known by the company he keeps but also a man is shaped by the company he gets. A good guy can be spoilt in bad company but his personality can be cleansed of the evils through good company which can act as a catalyst to exasperate the good in him and help him to get rid of bad habits and routines.Director Ahathian has directed the movie properly. The flaws are there in the screenplay as well as the chracterization of certain characters of the story. Still, I found the movie to be emotionally appealing and when it was over, I got the satisfaction of watching a good movie. Just like its subject matter, perhaps the movie also suffered from the labelling by the reviewers (as bad).Nadeem Shravan's music is a big asset of the movie. The title track (sung by Alka Yagnik and Kumar Sanu) is the best one which has been picturized very romantically. Other songs are also pretty good to listen. It's the debut movie of Reema Sen who not only looks pretty but has performed also quite well. Despite being the hero-oriented film, it's her character which is the pivotal wheel of the script. Fardeen Khan is not a very good actor but he has done satisfactorily in the assigned role. Among others, Suresh Oberai is excellent, rest all are routine. Apoorva Agnihotri has tried his level best as Mohan but his characterization itself is defective and unreal.Hum Ho Gaye Aapke is not a great movie but it is not so bad also as it was criticized when released. Well, I firmly opine that a good seed needs good soil, clean water, healthy environment and proper nurturing also to grow into a stout tree.","imdb_rating":0,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0}],"imdbId":"tt0292552"}
