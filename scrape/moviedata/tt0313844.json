I can say that because this films stands out completely from the crowd of typical Bollywood films with their stories about romantic drama. This film has proved that even bollywood can come up with hi-gadgetry and more of a Hollywood style stuff rather than normal dancing around the trees. I loved the idea of saving a disaster using modern technology and trying new things than doing some of that old fashioned stunts and spying.The computer effects were also pretty decent. This is one film that i would recommend to all those who are tired of watching romantic dramas from bollywood. Totally off the scale. The story is superb with the actors performing real good. I hope to see more of such films coming from bollywood. brilliant work.","imdb_rating":7,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" This is how patriotism should be","review":"I didn't have very high expectations from the film. But the very first scene got me a little curious watching an Indian officer using the computer to file some sort of a report. Our films always depict the Indian law enforcing agencies as primeval in their thinking, capability and resources. This film shatters all three myths. The film itself seems to be the main protagonist rather than any particular character. The story is very very interesting, especially the whole havala transaction. Danny and Gulshan Grover give good performances as do Milind Soman and Sushant Singh. I found debutante Dipannita Sharma to be a revelation for being in the thick of things rath er than just being thick in the head as most Hindi film heroines are. The 'Dil Mera Ek Tara' track is superb and nicely integrated into the film. The only drawback I can think of is the whole Aditi Govitrikar angle to the plot. That should have either not been there or at least rewritten. But Mani Shankar presents the real ideal patriotism: practical and intelligent. A well-deserved 9/10.","imdb_rating":9,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" An excellent well-researched and unique plot supported by great cinematography, special effects and most importantly direction.","review":"16 December should most definitely be considered for an award this year. A patriotic storyline and technologically enhanced yet believable action sequences will keep the local crowds attracted.  But this movie has something for everyone.  The technologically savvy will also definitely have something to appreciate with the holographic imaging scenes and fun little detective gadgets(For the first IMac lovers, there's plenty of those in here to).  For average Hindi movie standards, the special effects were extremely well done.  Portraying not only the works of terrorist organizations and political scoundrels, this film also does justice to the military and other special security operatives by exposing some their features and capabilities (if they are exaggerated, there is really no way for the layman to be sure). Apart from the thoroughly futile attempts at maintaining the usual love story in the background by adding a couple of songs, 16th December will keep you glued to the screen for the whole 2 and a half hours.","imdb_rating":9,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" A Must See.","review":"It's an awesome movie. Must watch for who criticize Bollywood for it's melodramatic movies. Manishankar has capability to become one of the best director. It is one of his best movie.Story is good and make you sit for 2+ hour.The best thing about the movie is screenplay which make it interesting. Plot is tight and fast paced. Acting is not so good by the new actors.Only Danny could impress with acting but it can be overlooked in exchange of good movie.so guys if you haven't seen it yet don't miss it.","imdb_rating":10,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" must watch bollywood movie.","review":"the pace with which this movie proceed simply awesome.one must watch this movie if he or she like Hollywood action thriller movies and support that in India more of these movies shield me made.all the character have done their best.the plot of movie is very good and the suspense in the end is outstanding.this movie deserves much better rating than this. this is Hollywood at his best.Milind Soman plays Vikram, a former intelligence agent brought back into the fold by Vir Vijay Singh (Danny Denzongpa), his former boss, who is investigating the illegal funnelling of city money into Swiss bank accounts. Working with his old team, Vikram soon discovers that what initially appears to be a case of large-scale white-collar crime is actually a conspiracy of more epic proportions, involving the financing of international terrorism and an attempt to nuke the city of Delhi.","imdb_rating":10,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" more like this is what India needs!!","review":"it is quite entertaining movie. keeps u al1 the time on edge of your seat. it depicts intelligent film making by mani shankar. very well written story. good direction and and better cinematography. Though actors didn't look matured apart from the supporting actor victor, danny and gulshan grover. Milind was expressionless same goes with actress. But overall good story telling. n i believe its a original one not a copy of some Hollywood flick!!though end was bit patchy and child genius concept was little difficult to grasp. overall complete movie is good stuff. A definitely recommend this to those who want to see some intelligent film making by Bollywood.","imdb_rating":9,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" Shines in the respected genre with given budget.","review":"What I remember this movie as... well as far as I know; it was the first movie with design and apparatus of style Hollywood. Even today movies with that level of accuracy are not made in bollywood. It was just yesterday I was discussing with my Friend regarding the new movie Kkrish, yes the one which has got enhanced mutants... Extra 20 minutes, extra fight, unnecessary scenes, I mean there was a lot to digest. A better movie could have been planned with reduced 20 minutes.This is where 16 December shines. A movie planned in budget which does maximum justice to budget cast and execution. Friends if you want to see A-grade movie involving defence chief, ministers, security agents all tackling on terror and made in India 16 December is worth a start.rating: 7.5/10","imdb_rating":8,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0}],"imdbId":"tt0313844"}
