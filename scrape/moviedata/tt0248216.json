Pretty good debut feature film","review":"NTJNH is Arjun Sablok's first feature film. And it's a pretty good debut. The first half hour is the weakest part of the film, with a song that should be cut, too slow a pace and some tired Bollywood antics. But then the film gets momentum and starts to deliver. There are still lesser moments that pay unnecessary tribute to the 'formula' (silly comedy bits, a clichéd gay character, a hero-beats-up-multiple-adversaries scene...) but they are outweighed by moments which show that the director has at times a firm grip on the various aspects of cinematic expression and uses his tools to good effect (camera, editing, sound effects). There is a delightful party dancing scene which has only one fault, it's too short. There is an equally effective scene involving a zipper. There is a comic scene that makes fun of Bollywood film making which directly leads into the inevitable declaration of love between hero and heroine and its expression in a song number, all elegantly executed. Also impressive is the scene around the intermission and the tell-me-your-name-scene which culminates in a wedding song, to name two more examples. Technically the film is uneven like almost all Bollywood films. Sharp shots and out of focus and filtered shots follow each other in random fashion, without a recognizable concept. Color balance is off at times. Both can be seen on the DVD as well as on 35mm prints. The 3 leads are all doing a good job. Hrithik Roshan tends to overact in comic scenes, but is on the other hand excellent in dramatic and emotional moments. Esha Deol has not got beauty queen looks, but something better instead: personality and charm. She has got talent. Saif Ali Khan plays once more a playboy, which he can do on autopilot by now. He's good as well. The film is above average but suffers somewhat from using Bollywood cliches and a not terribly original story, a variation of so many other Bollywood love stories. On the other hand the basic conflict is well established, the drama works and the execution with a good cast lifts the material often on the level of solid workmanship and a few times beyond.","imdb_rating":0,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" Sweet Romance","review":"-----POSSIBLY CONTAIN SPOILERS------ The main reason why I watch Hindi/Bollywood movies is because it provides an entertaining romance movie, even though some  of them suffering from lack of originality (taking to far from Hollywood Rip Off). Same but different case happens with Na Tum Jaano Na Hum. Inspired by the original version of Tom Hanks-Meg Ryan's `You've Got Mail', the plot is about romance that flows by the hands of letter, and then develops into a melodramatically flick. But the director try to not trap on the cliché that Bollywood tends to do and he almost success on it. The result is a sweet romance that guarantees to fairly satisfy you.Some songs are great, especially `Hey Ram'. The visualization of the songs are superb (I think all Bollywood movies should do this!). The acting is standard. But the direction is good. Arjun Sablok is a fine director. He knows to make movies with style. But I think he must learn more about the story writing technique. I expecting for his upcoming movies.In general, Na Tum Jaano Na Hum is a fine movie. Even though it's still not strong enough to be a classic Bollywood Romance, but this movie is worth watching.7/10","imdb_rating":7,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" Neither good nor bad","review":"There's nothing new about the story of Na Tum Jaano Na Hum. It is a pretty ordinary film where writing is concerned, telling the story of two good friends falling for the same girl without knowing about each other's feelings. The girl herself becomes engaged to one while being in love with the other. Yeh, this is quite typical but the movie has its moments and is actually quite charming at some points, especially the scenes involving Hrithik Roshan and Esha Deol. Otherwise the movie also has many moments of pure bore which seem to be the direct result of the director's attempts to make the movie slow in order to create a deep dramatic mood. I liked the songs: \"Di Leke\" is very nice, but my favourite song is \"Tum\". The performance by the playback singer who sings it is not particularly good, but the melody and the way the number appears on screen is quite effective. The movie stars Saif Ali Khan, and he is very likable and believable in another role that is both comic and serious. Esha Deol is actually pretty good in one of her first roles, but she once again tends to have a very serious expression on her face throughout the film. Maybe it's her own nature and way of being in real life which she is unable to erase when she is on screen, but otherwise she is convincing. The one who dominates the show with a heartfelt portrayal of a quietly loving guy is of course Hrithik Roshan, who plays the role with dedication and sincerity. The cast, however, is not reason enough to make the movie better than it was. Na Tum Jaano Na Hum is mostly an average product, a decent one-time watch and nothing more.","imdb_rating":5,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" Adorable movie","review":"This movie was so epic I love the storyline good movie but I am always happy with it because it was superb as well Screenplay is outstanding editing and direction are both excellent Hrithik was superb saif was impressive esha did well in her debut Songs are really enjoyable Overall 7/10Above average","imdb_rating":7,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" a cute different romantic outing","review":"first things first, this ain't a dil to pagal hai/ kuch kuch hota hai.. But it still is watchable thanks to its cutesy take on love. i mean the theme of ' there is someone made for you & you will definitely meet him \" , this all has been explored time & again in our movies. But getting to know about each other through anonymous letters & then actually meeting in person is indeed quite cool, though may be old as a concept but still is lovely.. i am all praise for the leads , especially hrithik who sleepwalks through the role & especially is adorable while vocalizing serious lines..God only knows what the audience wished of him to have lambasted his serious effort when the flick released.. Not to forget esha( her debut??) ,hers is the quite researched role of that of a young , a bit childish but mature in thinking types . She looks good in some moments & though her acting may not be class apart but she does justice to her role..Director does have potential of telling a good story,in fact i specially liked the serious scenes & romantic web he created.. Not at all a bad offering.. Ya, music is a big let down & to add to that the female playback singing is pathetic..

Watch the film itself and you'll keep taking toilet breaks in between. Rahul (Hrithik Roshan) and Esha (Esha Deol) are penpals who fall in love with each other. Sounds cute enough, but catch is; they know almost nothing about each other! Esha doesn't know Rahul's name. They've never seen each other, but she's precisely sure of how much she loves him. Here's an alleged twist. Rahul's lifelong best friend, Akshay (Saif Ali Khan), wants to marry Esha. So he sends Rahul to check Esha out. If Rahul approves of her, Akshay will marry her. So ho hum. Rahul and Esha meet, and have absolutely no idea who the other really is. Rahul realizes Esha is his secret love on her engagement night.The dialogue is bad, and the film moves at a very slow pace. At the end of the day, you don't feel for the characters. The love story between Esha and Rahul isn't developed enough for you to cry along with them. Esha keeps telling those around her, \"You won't understand.\" She's right. I don't understand either.Esha Deol isn't too bad an actress. She may not be the typical Bollywood beauty, but she's quite a delight to watch after some time. Saif Ali Khan is fine, but I do wish they'd stop giving him playboy roles. Hrithik Roshan is good. Shah Rukh Khan has a serious competitor in him!","imdb_rating":0,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" Another film on You've got Mail","review":"After Sirf Tum, This was another film on You've Got Mail though not much, This was Arjun Sablok's debut film as a director. It also brought Saif and Hrithik together and Esha's 2nd film. The film was in Hrithik's bad days when his films were flopping, this was his next bombing after AMALL. The film starts quite well but the comedy between Hrithik and Esha is amateurish however the interval point is well handled. The second half gets slow and predictable but picks up towards the end But the climax is predictable There are some good scenes like the scene when Hrithik and Esha travelling in a car hear the song Kya Yehi Pyaar Hai(From Rocky 1981). The action scene was not needed thoughDirection is good in parts Music by Rajesh Roshan is decent, Hrithik Roshan does well in his role however it was hardly anything challenging for him Saif is typecast as a casanova but lends some value to his role Esha is superb in her role though raw at times Amongst rest Rati and Mousami are wasted, Alok Nath is as usual There are blink and miss appearances of Preeti Jhaignani and Shilpa Saklani","imdb_rating":4,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0}],"imdbId":"tt0248216"}
