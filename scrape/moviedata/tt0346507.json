I didn't start watching them until recently, so I don't have extensive background knowledge that would enable me to connect the dots as I can with other films when it comes to Bollywood-oriented references, influences and the like, although it's frequent enough that Bollywood films reference American and other films for which I can connect the dots. But for all of the Bollywood films I've watched so far, I keep encountering reviews wherein the film is criticized for being clichéd, recycling plots, and so on. Andaaz is no exception. However, with the films I've watched so far, I haven't noticed anything yet that I'd call a recycled or rip-off plot. I'm starting to wonder if people are not looking at the films from a very \"distant\", generalized perspective, where they're seeing similarities because most Bollywood films involve romances that aren't exactly smooth sailing, conflicts with cultural traditions, and so on. That's not a factor of clichés or recycling plots, it's related to cultural facts and desires, and at \"worst\", it's a factor of defining the \"Bollywood\" genre.But even assuming Andaaz was recycling the plot of some famous precursor, so that it would be something like an uncredited remake, I don't agree that we should subtract points for that. What matters is how well the film does what it does. On those terms, Andaaz is excellent. It came extremely close to getting a 10 from me--only a few bits of stylistic awkwardness, mostly related to editing, lowered my score to a 9, but I'm tempted to overlook those flaws and go ahead with the 10.The story is centered on Raj (Akshay Kumar) and Kajal (Lara Dutta), who begin their relationship as childhood friends, when Kajal encouraged Raj to overcome a handicap--he had an accident and was wearing a leg brace. In a scene right out of Forrest Gump (1994), Kajal pushes Raj to skate like a pro, so that his brace pops right off and he's \"cured\". We jump ahead to Raj as a young adult when he's a local star footballer. He and Kajal are still close--but he's in love with her and she doesn't notice; she thinks they're just great friends. Raj goes off to the air force--primarily because Kajal has loved airplanes ever since she was a kid, and Raj wants to learn to fly for her. When he returns home, things have not gone quite as planned. Raj loses Kajal and becomes alienated and a bit bitter. Even when another beautiful woman, Jiya (Priyanka Chopra), tries to court him, he is not interested. There are a couple twists during the last hour or so, and the film ends up emphasizing important \"messages\" through its climax.Kumar is a very fine actor. The script requires him to go through a wide range of difficult emotional transformations, which he does with ease. The two female leads are also good, even if their performances are less wide-ranging, but both also have to undergo at least one important emotional/attitudinal transformation by the end of the film. There is also a number of entertaining support performances, including an amusing turn by Indian comedian Johnny Lever as \"G.I. Joe\".Of course as a mainstream Bollywood film, Andaaz is also a musical. The songs here are some of my favorites from a modern Bollywood film so far, although that may be partially because they've had more time to \"stew\"--I've owned the soundtrack on CD since it first came out in 2003. More than most other Bollywood films I've seen, director Raj Kanwar shoots the musical numbers in a strong western music video mode. This works most of the time, although one of the slight flaws in my opinion was an early musical number, \"Shalala Shalala\", with more of a disco feel and a 1980s look. But some of the later songs and accompanying visual sequences are breathtaking--especially the landscape stuff shot in South Africa, such as for \"Rabba Ishq Na Hove\". But Kanwar gives us pleasant cinematography throughout the film.Also interesting and unusual are some of the air force scenes, which at times resemble a cross between Top Gun (1986) and U.S. Armed Forces television commercials (which usually had admirable technical qualities). Even with such disparate elements, Kanwar keeps the story tight and focused, which isn't easy to do while meeting the typical range of Bollywood moods and stretching them out to about 2 and a half hours. There are a couple weird or corny editing effects and transitions, but these are relatively minor gaffes.The core of the film, though, is the heart-wrenching romantic material and the important themes/subtexts. Kanwar, who also wrote the story upon which the script was based, stresses that one must express one's feelings when one has them. A couple major plot points hinge on Raj avoiding communicating his feelings, but he's not the only person who has that problem in the film. There is also a very important theme and subtext about challenging cultural traditions, but Kanwar is careful to stress that such challenges shouldn't be done arbitrarily or across the board, just for their own sake. Jiya has problems with Raj because she's challenging traditions in a way that may be undesirable, but the climax hinges on the necessity of challenging traditions when it comes to \"true love\". Also during the climax, the emotional/attitudinal transformations that have been occurring throughout the film with all three principal characters (as well as some minor ones) reach their apex--everyone finally matures, emotionally and ethically.","imdb_rating":9,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" Nice typical masala with nice songs and nice star cast - nice!","review":"I recommend watching this film because it's very simple to follow and is overall a good time-pass flick. Nothing new, nothing special, but still quite entertaining. It is watchable mainly due to its great melodious songs and its starring cast. Akshay Kumar is very sincere and effective as the sensitive Raj Malhotra. Beauty pageants Lara Dutta and Priyanka Chopra made a great debut. Lara impressed more, as she was the leading lady and had a good footage to showcase her histrionics. But Priyanka was much more fun to watch. She was attractive, naughty, vivacious and sexy. I'm not going to watch it again, but I really enjoyed the film for its light content and its profound Hindi film style.","imdb_rating":6,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" what a sight (andaaz)","review":"What can I say about Andaaz?Why is the world such a small place in bollywood movies? One should pass a law on coincidental occurrences in bollywood movies, and maybe them will they take notice of the real world going on's.Akshay acting has really matured from the time he joined bollywood, with the most dramatic turn change since Dhadkan, with his acting in andaaz being very good. Lara and Priyanka are, well. typical beauty queens trying to act. To be honest they have potential, especially Lara, but I guess we will have to wait and see if she becomes another Ash or Namrita!Positive points about the movie, apart from Akshay, are the songs which are really good, as are their picturisations. Story wise, it is the typical same old story recycled for the modern genre, with new faces and more skin. I think that the producers are hoping for the less-is-more theory, i.e. less clothes means more box-office receipts. But seriously, we need to get new and fresh screenwriters into the industry to bring in line with the demands of the new generation.","imdb_rating":0,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" Wrong couple, with usual story","review":"VERY DISAPPOINTED. Bollywood never changed, the genre is always, one man with two woman and the man always choose his best friend not his new love. What is the meaning if we can find our new love which can make us happy and laugh again, why we must choose our first love whom already leave us? It just because of love or just because that he/she is something that we want to get.Bollywood's weakness is the story line. Same genre, which is very non sense. Even the actor and the actress can't play good. With such a bad scenario and always same genre story, how can they could performances their true act.","imdb_rating":5,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" Old Story... Poorly directed and performed.....","review":"\"Andaaz\" remains one of the forgettable movies of the recent past, owing to its poor story and its delivery. A love triangle combined with the story of family and faith could have been obviously presented better had the script or characters been worked out better. Here the story and narration don't look much interesting and performances are yet a major let down. Akshay Kumar had done many such average and forgettable movies in the time which won't be a major debacle in his filmography. Among two heroines, Lara Dutt looks a bit good in her latter role; whereas Priyanka Chopra in her first film gets unnoticed owing to a very weak and half cooked role. Overall it's a very routine film from Raj Kanwar, who has given better films like \"Humko Deewane Kar Gaye\" or \"Judaai.\" Rating: 1 star out of 4","imdb_rating":3,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" Great Movie!!!!","review":"Here's another bright one then, in a brightly-wrapped andaaz. Raj Kanwar, the man who has splurged in masala in all its possible hues over the past decade or so, comes up with ? guess what? ? a story about two girls in love with the same guy. This 'ex-flame come back from the dead' formula is, of course, not new for Kanwar. He has already done it long back with Deewana, the film that introduced Shah Rukh Khan to popular imagination.Raj (Akshay Kumar) and Kajal (Lara Dutta) are childhood friends and spend most of the time with the campus gang (hiccup: Akshay Kumar as a college boy?!). Raj secretly loves the tomboyish Kajal and his dream is to make it as an Air Force pilot and settle down with her. While on tomboys, the script does a reverse Kuch Kuch Hota Hai here ? when Raj returns as an officer in uniform, Kajal has already given her heart to Karan Singhania (Aman Verma), who could be a walking endorsement of the Perfect Man in all those suiting ads ? sophisticated, stinking rich, and with a heart of gold.Post interval, by the time Raj meets Jiya (Priyanka Chopra) in Europe, you've already got a hang of Kanwar's caper. The extrovert Jiya throws herself on Raj, woos his bhaiyya and bhabhi too and voila! ? Raj has agreed to marry her. But wait, Karan is dead in an accident and Jiya, it turns out, is his sister. So, when Raj meets Kajal once again, old flames are rekindled. Love triangle tangle time hereon.With two former beauty queens gunning to serve a hotter peekaboo plethora, you can't possibly complain over timepass with Andaaz. Credit to Akshay Kumar, then ? he still manages to hold a fair amount of your visual attention span, (pleasantly) wedged as he is between the sultry sirens.","imdb_rating":10,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" What is Love","review":"One of the best films I have watched.

Raj attends the wedding then goes abroad where he meets Jiya (Priyanka Chopra also in her debut role) a man eating temptress he finds very hard to shake off. He doesn't want to have anything to do with Jiya because he isn't completely over Kajal. Sooner than later, he returns home to India to find Kajal in mourning as her husband passed away in an air-crash. Raj tries to console her but things are dampened when Jiya follows him to India and reveals herself as the younger sister of Kajal's deceased husband. There's really no big deal about this movie, except for the fact that it marks to career debuts of both former beauty Queens Lara Dutta (Miss Universe 2000) and Priyanka Chopra (Miss World & Miss India 2000). Some of the songs are nice and decently choreographed but that's about it.","imdb_rating":6,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" Alright, but we've seen it all before.","review":"The acting is fine and I guess the plot is OK. However, we've seen it all before. Guy meets girl and falls in love with her, he then loses her and is chased by another girl. He chooses her but later discards her just like that for the first girl when she comes back to him. How many times have we seen this? Many, many times! I personally feel frustrated with this plot line as well. However, the additions to this basic plot make it an OK film. Akshay Kumar once again shows how he can play a vast array of roles very well. Both the actresses do an OK job as well. So go ahead and watch it if you have not much else to do, but there is better out there.","imdb_rating":6,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" spoiler---awful movie","review":"This movie was too sicken for words. It was unrealistic and the man character fit his name in the movie, \"stupid\". I really enjoy the character who portrayed Jiya. Her interactions were the highlight of the movie. Once we went back to the other female, the movie tanked. Don't bother spending your money for the movie.....he dumps jiya and goes back to the other one. And how he proposes is ridicules. Jiya causes a scene during their engagement party accusing the other girl of loving her finance and her finance loving her. Then she demands to know what he feels for her, and he goes and dumps the red powder on her head and proclaims her his wife. Then everyone sings and dances and accepts his choice, at jiya's father house. What nonsense!!!","imdb_rating":1,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" A very well made film despite the worn out story....","review":"If you think back to the golden era of bollywood, the stories were simple the drama suttle and the outcomes keeping in with the views of the people of the time. So take an old story made time and time again, the classic love triangle and give it an extremely modern twist and you have Andaaz.The style and the atmosphere has been handled extremely well. the feeling and the settings perfect. Take a very handsome Akshay Kumar and pair him with two of the mos beautiful women in the world. Lara Dutta & Priyaka chopra are simply stunning. The three work extremely well together. The sexuall chemistry is fantastic.The story though very well made unfortunately sinks a litte in the middle and you hit a low before it gets rounded up with a high yet one cant help feeling that the ending was a bit abrupt. alot of the middle section and bits in the begining could have been edited out, as bits of the film definatley look better than others and the film suffers a little at times. Ufortunately the old fashioned story does not fit too well with the highly modern outlook. All in all a very well made film with a story that could have been alot better...","imdb_rating":0,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" very boring...seen it all before","review":"A re-make of prem rog... a very boring movie....and very predictable... u all have seen it before.... whats the point watching it all over again. Only worth watching the two models..lara dutta and priyanka chopra...they will become good actresses!!","imdb_rating":3,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0}],"imdbId":"tt0346507"}
