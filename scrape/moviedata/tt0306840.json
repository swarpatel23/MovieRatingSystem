This one is pretty much a movie of its own, but as a movie, I somehow felt that something was missing. The movie starts off as a quiet romance and later we are presented with a surprising twist, which turns the movie into a dramatic suspense thriller. The film is not entirely convincing though it has its share of good moments. This movie marks the debut of Esha Deol, the daughter of Dharmendra and Hema Malini. Esha is pretty and she dances very well, just like her mother did. She is not even close to being as beautiful as her mother was and she does not have her charm either, but in terms of acting she does a pretty decent debut. At times she really is way too serious but overall she is good. Aftab Shivdasani is solid as Aman, a guy who hopelessly falls in love with Esha without knowing of her past. Jaya Bachchan plays her role with her usual depth. Sanjay Kapoor wavers between good and painfully bad. The film's ending is unexpected but it's okay. The same can be said about the film. Koi Mere Dil Se Poochhe is an okay one-time watch, and nothing more.","imdb_rating":4,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" Another remake of SWTE","review":"'Koi Mere Dil Se Pooche' is another remake of 'Sleeping with the Enemy' starring Julia Roberts after Agnisakshi, Daraar and Yaraana.Surprisingly, 'KMDSP' turned out to be a good remake of SWTE with its own twists and turns.'KMDSP' is Esha Deol's debut movie. Esha is Dharmendra and Hema Malini's daughter. And surprisingly, she can emote well on screen.Sanjay Kapoor is strictly okay. Nothing much can be said about him. He does look different in a negative role but not terrorising which his role demanded.Aftab Shivdasani is just okay. He has miles to go to scale the ladder of success in the industry.Jaya Bachchan was excellent. Jaspal Bhatti is as usual a nuisance.Overall, a good movie if not excellent. Watch it if you haven't done yet.","imdb_rating":10,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" exciting movie 100 out of 100 watch today","review":"it keeps u on the edge of your seat all the time . i have see it 3 times. you will love this and every one should watch!! i mean wen i was first suggested to watch this by some of my friends i was like OK but what will be great but when i saw it i was like wow ! this is a great movie. amazing acting by aftab shivdasani. he looks amazingly charming n this movie and esha deol looks so fresh she gets her great acting skills from her mom hema malini and i swear i will watch this again. i rented a DVD first but then i purchased it only.this excites you and makes you want to know what happens in the end. but then you want to watch and the climax is the best part. you know what will happen but your like oh will it or wont it. but when it does or doesn't i cant say but you will like it. once you watch it you will call and thank that i suggested this to you. it is amazing and nice and super and duper! you will love it so o now buy hurry buy buy. buy today. buy during reading this as this ends really well.","imdb_rating":10,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0}],"imdbId":"tt0306840"}
