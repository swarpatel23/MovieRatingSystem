Still, they keep bumping into each other on their rather difficult journey home until the frequency of music and dance scenes starts getting higher (i. e. they have fallen in love). The plot is said to have been modelled on the Hollywood flick Forces of Nature (which I haven't seen). Though quite average, I'd still consider this an ok movie: well choreographed song and dance scenes (though not particularly spectacular ones) and nice, good-looking, rather believable actors in the main roles. Though it was quite peculiar that many dialog scenes were very badly filmed (with bad lighting and awkward camera movements), while in the music and dance sequences the cinematographer seems to have changed: they were just perfect! There you can see again what is most important about masala movies... This was the second Bollyfilm I have seen as a whole, so I cannot compare it really to lots of others, but I'd still say this is an average, but definitely watchable film, probably also for European audiences. I think here especially of the target group of older Eastern European women who love Latin-American soap-operas (like in my native Hungary) - they'd surely like this one, too... :)","imdb_rating":0,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0}],"imdbId":"tt0313395"}
