flicks like Kya Yehi Pyaar Hai, Durga and Vadh, there comes a film that restores your faith in Bollywood.Aankhen has a Hollywood-style bank robbery plot executed without compromising too much on the three must-haves of Hindi films --- songs, three hours and gaping holes in the plot.Vijay Singh Rajput (Amitabh Bachchan) is the manager of Vilasrao Jefferson bank. He has chosen celibacy to prove his dedication to his work. But his pent-up frustrations burst out against his employees --- the watchman caught sleeping on the job, the cashier who tries to siphon off a few notes before he hands it over the counter.After he beats the living daylights out of the nincompoop sweaty cashier, Rajput is fired from the bank he has served for over 25 years.The official reason for his behaviour is that Rajput has schizophrenia, which explains why he is obsessed with taking revenge on his employers and co-workers --- all of which some of us fantasize about through our lives. The only difference is that Rajput goes a step further and does what others only dream of doing --- get even with the bosses.He decides to extract his revenge by robbing the bank and finds a cast of three blind men, Vishwas Prajapati (Akshay Kumar), Arjun Verma (Arjun Rampal) and Ilias (Paresh Rawal). Svelte teacher Neha Srivastav (Sushmita Sen) also carries out his bidding.While the three blind men are in it for the money, Neha plays along because Rajput has her younger brother captive. Using her skills as a teacher, Neha simulates the bank's interiors and teaches the trio the tricks to pull off the heist.After over 40 days of training in a simulated environment, the three blind men step into the bank to pull off the most novel bank robbery Bollywood has seen. How they do it forms the rest of the film.Aankhen defies all the rules of commercial Hindi cinema. The heroes are blind and are actually listen to a woman who seems more intelligent and capable than all of them put together.The plot doesn't lose sight of its goal -- the bank robbery -- and refuses to get side-tracked into mindless romance or songs. Conceived and executed like a taut Hollywood thriller, Aankhen is an impressive breakaway from the cliché ridden formula filmmaking that afflicts Bollywood.The credit for this belongs to debutant director Vipul Shah and his team. Shah is in completely in control of the film, whether it is in the dramatic sequences or developing the chemistry among the cast.The story of Aankhen has been adapted by writer Aatish Kapadia from his own Gujarati play, Andhla Pato (Blindman's Buff), first staged in 1992. Thanks to his experience with the theatre where taut scripts are necessary to hold the act together, Kapadia's screenplay is one of the film's strong points.The other is the cast and characterisation.As Vijay Singh Rajput, Amitabh Bachchan has turned in one of the finest performances of his career. He pulls off the most ludicrous situations with credibility and style. In a role that changes colours, starting as an upright bank officer morphing into a man obsessed with pulling off a bank robbery for revenge and finally turning into the villain who is prepared to go to any lengths to get his booty, Bachchan is glorious. He proves himself worth the sobriquet of the 'superstar' of Hindi cinema.Not to say that the others are overshadowed by his presence. As the blind man with that extra-sensory perception, Akshay Kumar holds his own in every scene. He brush-offs with Bachchan are dramatic and he brings a quiet intelligence and depth to his role. Every time he senses the silent Rajput hovering in the background, the screen crackles with electricity.The chemistry between him and Paresh Rawal is delightful. Akshay's thinking demeanor offsets Rawal's light-hearted quick-to-crack a joke countenance. With a role that is funny and irreverent, Rawal gathers the audience's laughs and proves his onscreen brilliance yet again.Arjun Rampal looks good, has a good body and a goodr screen presence but falls flat, partly due to poor characterisation. His is the only role that appears half-baked and Rampal only makes it worse.Sushmita Sen's role of Neha deserves an extra round of applause. Unlike most Hindi film heroines who come across as bimbettes and whose only aim is to get into the hero's way at the climax, Neha doesn't need a man to exist. She is intelligent and capable, even during the climax.However, the film has its fair share of flaws. The pace tends to sag intermittently and the actual robbery comes as an anti-climax to the tension built during the training. Besides, the robbery also appears terribly tame.The three-hour film tends to get you a little fidgety towards the end. Bipasha Basu and Kashmira Shah in 'item' numbers aggravate the cramped legs in an already stretched out film.But in all, Aankhen is different from your usual Hindi flick. It is a fast paced, slick thriller, a species rarely encountered in the annals of the Hindi film industry.","imdb_rating":8,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" Reasonably gripping movie with surprising twists unique to Indian cinema","review":"The movie is about a recently fired schizophrenic bank manager scheming to get even with his employers by robbing the bank with the help of three blind men and a beautiful blind school teacher! Amitabh Bachchan as the bank manager excels in his role. He is one of the most talented guys out there today. Pity not all his movies are as good as this one or his earlier Aks. The movie moves with a fast pace initially, but slows down towards the middle with cursory song and dance sequences spoiling its pace(the two songs - one with the three blind guys and the other in the bar are very painful to sit through). It picks up pace towards the end and even has quite a few surprising twists that I most certainly didn't expect in a mainstream hindi movie! Good job director and script writer! Thank goodness you didn't make the movie boring by removing those twists and giving us a bland fare which most box-office fearing mediocre directors would have done. Akshay, Paresh, Arjun and Sush all perform their roles well. There are a few glitches in the movie - like the name of the bank. A most ridiculous name. Then the location of the bank itself. A bank that has a lobby looking like that of a 3-star hotel is located in the midst of a busy and dirty side street in Mumbai! Sure! None of the songs are appealing, except the one with Bipasha Basu - in fact the rest of the songs are really irritating and definitely jarring in the midst of an interesting screenplay. Directors of India - I LOVE songs in a movie; but not when it interrupts the movie's flow drastically. Overall, a must see movie.","imdb_rating":9,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" Topnotch directing and good acting over somewhat weak screenplay","review":"That pretty much sums it up.  As heist thrillers go, this is a pretty solid movie.  The lengthy time actually works in its favor, because it allows the main characters to be fully fleshed out.  Unless you're David Mamet, it's pretty hard to do a 90 minute heist movie and have you care about the people involved.  From an American perspective, this movie is quite fresh, both in the concept and the lack of American stereotypes (there's no young punk, retired thief returning for one last score, or anything like that here.) Also, the tension level is excellently done. That said, there are some major credibility issues; you can buy something like \"Heist\" working, but \"Aankhen\" it's best to turn your brain off. This is more along the lines of something like \"To Catch a Thief\"; you don't buy it but the ride's so much fun you don't care.The directing by Vipul Shah definitely deserves kudos on the visual end and with the actors; the director uses both the foreground AND the background, unconcerned with what's in focus and what isn't (and in fact drops in a few jokes), and the framing is quite precise.  Even when he's constrained by the necessity of suddenly making a music video, he does his best.  The acting isn't perfect, but the actors are convincing in their handicapped and Amitabh Bachchan comes off as one cold-blooded hombre.This is definitely worth a look, a superior slice of dumb fun.","imdb_rating":0,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" Aankhen is a must see","review":"The other guy that commented on this movie, obviously didn't know what he was talking about. This movie was great. One of a few thrillers from Bollywood. Sushmita Sen, and Arjun Rampal gave a breath taking performance. Amitabh was great as usual. The plot line of this movie was good, and it keeps your attention with twists and turns along the way. By the way, for the guy that asked, Aankhen means blind. Before you rent, or buy a Bollywood movie, you have to be ready to listen, to a lot of song, and watch a lot of dances. Indians who have a rough life, like to watch movies with a lot of songs to up lift their spirits. If you like bollywood movies, this one is very very good. It is a must see!

As a result he is fired from his job. A broken and angry Rajput, who has given all his life to this bank, is decisive to take revenge, and what can be a better way to take revenge if not rob the bank itself? His plan is further progressed when he meets Neha, a teacher at a blind school. Rajput decides to use Neha to fulfill his plan, and he kidnaps her young brother to blackmail her. He then finds the ultimate team of three blind men: Vishwas, Arjun and Ilias. What happens next is what forms the film's suspense.That's the basic story of Aankhen, a highly enjoyable and twisted thriller which is quite cleverly scripted. The film's concept is rather unusual for Hindi movies, and even though the story is hard to believe, the film is captivating and is generally well developed and convincingly made. Aspects that contribute to it include the great cinematography, the effective editing, the witty dialogues, and the unpredictable proceedings. The film is not without its flaws, and at times it really lacks depth and focus. The character of Rajput is particularly faulty in this regard. Towards the end, after the robbery scene everyone was much awaiting happens, the film loses its balance, and the ending is quite disappointing.Aankhen is well acted, and of course Amitabh Bachchan excels in his negative role which allows him to have fun with his character's inexplicable nature. Akshay Kumar is very good as the sensible and intelligent Vishwas, and Arjun Rampal is well cast as the kindhearted Arjun. The film, however, has two actors who utterly steal the show, and they are Sushmita Sen and Paresh Rawal. Sen is outstanding as the tormented and vulnerable Neha, and Rawal is also superb in a wonderful comic role which is both funny and touching. What I liked about the film is that every character was given a story of its own, thus making easy to understand their motives to do what they did.In a few words, Aankhen is very good Hindi entertainment, and in spite of its flaws manages to be a good watch with family and friends.","imdb_rating":7,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" a very good thriller","review":"i believe that Vipul Amrutlal shah has done a great job on this movie i watched it 2 maybe 3 times i loved it the only painful part about this movie is the sadness which usually happens around Paresh Rawal(Illias) but i guess writer Aatish Kapadia who adapted shobana desai's andhalo pato into a hard packing screenplay really makes up for the sadness or the inability to do anything which he surpasses in the end it is not like a good ending or a bad ending it's the ending the type of ending which shakes the story and gives ti a whole new turn after unbelievable chaos has occurred thumbs up to vipul amrutlal shah for a slick thriller","imdb_rating":10,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" A Game worth Watching","review":"Aankhen, A Dangerous Game is a film worth watching just for the superb acting. Starring Amithabh Bachan, Akshay Kumar, Shushmita Sen, Arjun Rampal and Paresh Rawal is a great noteworthy cast. The Big B excels himself playing the shizophrenic bank manager, who after getting the sack from his beloved bank decides to seek revenge by carrying out a bank robbery. His performance is electrifying,(very DeNiro like) even when he is not talking his expressions tell it all. Aside from his acting the guy looks great too, not totally reinventing himself but the last shot of him leaves you thinking whether that was just Amithabh Bachan ( or Ali G)Akshay Kumar as Vishwas performs great but mainly because his character is more developed than that of Arjun Rampal. Akshay plays one of the blind men with a a twist, he has a sixth sense. At first this seemed absurd but it provided a reason for the great scenes between Akshay and Amithabh Bachan so it could possibly be excused by the audience.Arjun's performance is somewhat overshadowed by the rest of the cast. His character Arjun provides the subtle love story developing with Shushmita Sen. Arjun looked great although it can be criticised that he and Akshay looked too good to be blind men, but the movie is very much in this century, where not every blind person is seen as poor, although Paresh was given that role for good measure. Paresh Rawal as Ilias gives an outstanding performance. In Aankhen he is given the opportunity to shine whereas in many of his past films, he is the same old villain or the joker who is only there to provide the laughs. Ok so the latter point may be true in this film too but here it is the relationship between the three blind men that give it its subtle humour, allowing the audience to relate to the characters.\nShushmita Sen plays Neha the schoolteacher who is there to train the blind men. Not only does she look great on screen without the skimpy dresses but also her ability to carry out the role has to be her greatest performance so far. Although she does nothing outstanding in the movie that will leave you in awe of her, her acting throughout the whole film is consistent and you are left with no doubt of her brilliant performance.\nThe script is great and deserves a round of applause, the debut from the director has proved that he is one to look out for. The climax to the film is thrilling and makes sure that everything comes out completely intact without any details left out. Although it has to be said that although the ending is different it does leave the viewer unsatisfied.The music is not upto scratch and could have been improved.Overall if you've watched Oceans Eleven this could be said to be the Hindi version. A must watch for any movie goer. If you want to see something different from Bollywood this is the one, hopefully more great story lines are to come abt, (heard Company is a good one to watch out for.\nThis is one Game that should not be Missed!!!","imdb_rating":0,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" Original adaptation of a gujarati play, thrilling","review":"Aankhen means 'eyes', the story of training three blind people to rob a bank in getting revenge proves for on the edge of the seat viewing. Amitabh again gives priceless acting, Akshay and Arjun Rampal are good supporting cast but Paresh Rawal is great adding great humour. Some of the songs in the films are obviously intended for the indian audience, as films fare poorly in record sales if a film has no songs.The editing seems a littles inaccurate at times and this is clearly a flaw in the film, if bollywood was to bring out more original themes such as this film it would propel it to a new level.On the whole, vintage amitabh and some scenes in the film especially between Akshay and the former are ones to remember.","imdb_rating":0,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" A must watch for Amitabh fans!","review":"I have just seen AANKHEN and I am surprised to say that this film is very good. It is based on a Gujarati play ANDHALO PAATO and is as good as the original. The story revolves around a mentally unstable Vijay Singh Rajput (Amitabh Bachchan) who plots to rob the bank he has worked for so many years assiduously. To do so, he hires a teacher for the blind, Neha (Sushmita Sen). Vijay tells Neha to recruit three blind men, Vishwas (Akshay Kumar), Arjun (Arjun Rampal) and Ilias (Paresh Rawal). All said and done, the three men do rob the bank. But after the robbery, things go seriously haywire. There are murders, investigations, stolen loots etc. The credit for the entire film must go to the great, Amitabh Bachchan. He proves yet again why he is one of the versatile actors of Bollywood. He is one of the few actors in the industry who want to experiment with diverse roles. Just when Bachchan's fans thought that he couldn't get any better in terms of versatility, he strikes again with an out and out negative performance. He starts off as an honest and dedicated man who has devoted his life to the bank and then he displays his grey shades, that of a man obsessed with destroying the bank and its employees who kicked him out. Bachchan's character has shades of his character from his previous flick, AKS. Here, Bachchan goes one step ahead and delivers a knockout performance. Akshay Kumar is showing vast improvement as an actor. He has really improved on his acting skills and also got good dialogues to mouth.Arjun Rampal is a miscast for his role. He tries too hard to bring the right emotions on his face but fails. The modulation in his strong voice is surely missing which kind of ruins his overall effort as an actor. On the other hand, I think out of the 3 people, Paresh Rawal as Ilias stood out in every aspects. He is a natural with good comic skills and emoting abilities. He is definitely the best in this movie next to Bachchan.Sushmita Sen as Neha did a really nice job. She exhibits raw talent and emotes really well on screen. Her scenes with Bachchan are excellent.The rest of the cast lend able support. Aditya Panscholi is excellent as the cop and Bipasha Basu and Kashmira Shah look hot in their guest appearances in two songs. The songs are also good in this film, especially \"phatella jeb\" and \"gustakhiyan\". The film drags a little bit in the first half, but the second half explodes with really good performances from almost all of the star casts and the climax is simply unusual and brilliant. Overall, a brilliant movie with good performances, especially from the veteran Amitabh Bachchan and it's a must watch for all of his fans! I rate it 9/10.","imdb_rating":0,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" Excellent thriller!!","review":"I really enjoyed this. I had come to watch it not knowing what to expect. I had heard the part about all the characters being blind but not much else. What i discovered was an excellent bank heist thriller with great turns from Amitabh Bachchan and Akshay Kumar (who i normally don't like, in fact i thought he was very good in this).Even arjun rampal, who is a very dull screen personality, came across well. I always find he is better playing blind guys (see also VAADA) or villains (see Om Shanti Om). Sushmita Sen was great, she is very pretty, i wish the romance between her and arjun could have been developed a little more (or maybe they should do another film together as they make a nice pair)but it probably would have spolied the tone of Aankhen.Overall it was a film that really draws you in.

A bank robbery is planned by a disgruntled ex-employee who is upset because he was fired. The plan involves recruiting 3 blind people, training them, etc. The goal, of course, is to rob the bank while making all the witnesses believe that the perpetrators were not blind. If they are caught, who would believe that they were the thieves, right ? But, twists, double crosses and love-twists abound. Understandably, filming such an intricate plot elegantly is beyond Bollywood writers/directors. The plot gets somewhat flimsy at places, where the director tries to forcibly insert some bollywood-ese sections. On the whole, a worthwhile film to watch. Amitabh shines.

He prides himself on the work that he does there and is one of those sort of over-worked and under-paid types. One day, he catches an employee cheating an old customer out of her savings and beats the living daylight out of the culprit. He leaves the man near dead, causing his co-workers to question whether he over-reacted to the issue at hand. This causes the bank to let go of Rajput as an employee, further infuriating him as he had put in a lot of time, years, efforts, blood, sweat and tears into making sure the bank was secure. Alone at home one day, with nothing else to do, he devises a plot to rob the bank from the inside out, using three blind men whom he soon hires to teach the bank a lesson. Vishwas Prajapati, Arjun Verma, & Ilias (played by Akshay Kumar, Arjun Rampal and Paresh Rawal respectively) are the three he chooses and abducts the young brother of Neha Srivastav (played by a very matronly Sushmita Sen) in order to get Neha to agree to train the men in his stead. Blink and you'll miss Bipasha Basu in a cameo as Raina Vishwas's girlfriend. And Kashmira Shah makes a special appearance in the item number 'Chalka Chalka.' Rampal, Rawal and Kumar are especially hilarious a the dynamic bank robbing trio and Rawal is especially hilarious. The chemistry amongst the men is superb, even if the pairing of Sen and Rampal wasn't particularly great.

I have seen wonderful Indian films like 'Monsoon Wedding', and very good films films made by Indian directors working in the US or UK. 'Aankhen' (anybody knows what this means?) however belongs to the cheap entertainment category. It seems to try to confirm all the evil rumors about Indian films - cheap melodrama mixed with infantile comedy, emphatic acting, and video clips like songs inserted in the film, cutting the logic of the story. The film certainly tries to do some things that are different - the idea of the story is original enough, and I would not be surprised if some big US studio will buy and do a remake in the future. The main actor is very good (but the haircut!!!), and the first half of the film builds some tension, unfortunately completely lost in the second half, which would have gotten an 'unsatisfactory' rate for logic and story telling at any decent cinema art school. The Indian cinema may be very prolific, and millions of people may like this kind of films, but sorry, this is not for me.

But unfortunately old habits die hard!There are many problems that ruined the good material. First, it is the bore. Some scenes could have been shorter. And the songs did interrupt the pace. But aside from being part of the original formula in their movie-making, it's in the Indian blood to sing!Secondly, the second half. All of it is nearly a long joke. Since the start of the heist, things ranged between being a heist movie and a ridiculous comedy. How many times (Amitabh Bachchan) got into the operation; that was enough to suspect him. Look at the incredibly hideous make-up of the blind thieves; it's like \"We're masked thieves, come and get us\"!! Confessing everything, with the names and the places of the robbers, in front of the driver they chose--was beyond dumb. And the changing of the boards that tell the place and time of every single scene; was at first thrilling, then turned into something unnecessary, and pure annoying!Then, we come to the terrible matter of the last 15 minutes. The end of the drunken blind man; here's melodrama that fits a pretty usual Indian movie. The girl kills herself while she doesn't know the place of her brother; this is the \"blind\" Indian tragedy at its best! Let alone things like: the gang is having all of their fights, screams, gunshots while the door of the villa, where the training center is, is WIDE OPEN (so the neighbors are deaf!), the situation of \"switch the light off, so we're equal now\" gave the worst remake ever for (Wait Until Dark - 1967) since the lights were on everywhere, and the faces of the actors were so clear, the police officer believes that the 2 living members of the gang are blind so fast, and last but not the least the too much dialogue at the end when (Bachchan) is trying to prove the very members guilty--gave me a real headache!Thirdly, the acting. Surely with that atmosphere, the matters must grow bad. I don't think that the 3 actors who acted the blind men got any time to watch and observe actual blind men. Their performance was fake; without the small details that a role of that kind demands. In a word, they were actors who act as blind. The big B takes on a fine role, being an evil man for a rare, very rare, time which says a lot about an actor in him who wants to take chances. And although he was great in his silent scenes as angry wounded man and wily mastermind, but in his talking scenes, he raised his voice a lot, and gone theatrical. Now I think this is the appropriate time to blame the director of this movie!So, songs, melodrama, naive points, too much dialogue; it's the same old Indian cinema all over again, and in its so weak shape as well. The ambition to be different was tangible, but it isn't enough alone.
