That ruins every attempt to make it a gross-out-comedy. Not that this is bad, of course. What remains is more a teen-version of the enchanting Aamir-Khan-Hit \"Dil Chahta Hai\". Or even closer: Bollywood's answer to the Israeli smash hit \"Lemon Popsicle/Eskimo Limon\" (1978).What's funny is that those two movies are essentially movies about male bonding and the search for women. Therefore they are considered films about men for men. YKHRH however might prove to be more successful with the ladies, mainly because of the cast. Prashant Chianani who plays Ranjiv looks straight out of a Playgirl-calendar and you sometimes get the feeling, the camera is actually making love to his body. The guy who plays Johnny is equally cute.That all is for the female audience to sink their teeth into - but the men shouldn't be disappointed. There's an attractive female cast, some crude humor and a nice message about male friendship. Not too bad either.Still, I wouldn't rate YKHRH too hight because with the exception of the first song, the music is highly average. The acting is so-so and the novelty factor rather low. It is entertaining .. that's why I'd give it a rather generousRating: 6/10","imdb_rating":6,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0}],"imdbId":"tt0338566"}
