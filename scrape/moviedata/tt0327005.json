debut in MUJHE KUCCH KEHNA HAI came back with a drab film. The film tries to be different and starts off well but the comedy and romantic portions are anything but funny or romantic. The interval point is well handled but the second half irritates with character confusions, sudden change of heart of Tusshar and a predictable climaxDirection is not up to the mark Music is saving grace, Nikamma was a big hit song, Taaza Taaza is another hit songs rest songs too are good, however Nikamma is ill placedTusshar was quite good in MKKH but here he irritates, also his character is confused, Esha irritates in light scenes but is decent otherwise Rajesh Khanna doesn't impress, Smita Jaykar, Raj Babbar and others are okay","imdb_rating":1,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" a cute tale of young love...","review":"Esha Deol plays a young exchange student who goes to school in Australia for one year and falls in love with an equally cute and young Indian boy (played by Tushar Kapoor) she meets there. The problem he is set in his ways, in that he does not believe in love and marriage because of his relationship with his parents whose marriage is filled with many years of bickering and hate. Esha tries to reach her lover before her parents marry her off to another suitor but he is so pin-headed that he keeps on upsetting her and her family and his family along the way as he sticks to his guns never to marry in order to preserve his love for Esha. The songs are great as are the costumes but this story has been told so many times in Bollywood romance flicks that it seems like a passing soap opera here than a box office material film. Nevertheless, Tusshar and Esha make a great eye candy couple with young love.","imdb_rating":7,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0}],"imdbId":"tt0327005"}
