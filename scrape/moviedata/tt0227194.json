It is an action-packed comedy-drama, and somehow reminded me of the 1993 movie 'Hum Hai Rahi Pyaar Ke'. Here too Juhi Chawla is the governess of children who are under the hero's custody though they are not his children. The movie was mainly watchable because of the leading stars, Shahrukh Khan and Juhi Chawla. They really rock together as was evidenced in previous projects like 'Raju Ban Gaya Gentleman', 'Darr' and 'Yes Boss'. They are very comfortable working together and it is very obvious. Shahrukh Khan is fantastic here. He is a great action star, though he is better known for his romantic roles. Here he is completely restrained and serious as the tough policeman, a role we don't see him playing that often. But the one who completely blew me away is Juhi. A gifted comedienne, she is absolutely charming and hilarious in a comic role which seems to be tailor-made for her. This is one of her most entertaining performances. The kids are quite good. Jackie Shroff is there for something like half-an-hour and he's okay. Towards the end the story gets a bit confusing and it is very easy to lose interest in the film mainly due to its lack of focus. However, there are some things to be said in its favour: unlike most Hindi films we use to watch and like, this one is neither melodramatic nor overly emotional. The narrative style, which is surprisingly a bit dark and dim, is very effective and special, and A.R. Rahman's music is nice as well. 'One 2 Ka 4' is not a great film, but it is a good entertainer and you definitely can watch it for the rather interesting story and particularly for the actors.","imdb_rating":7,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" An all out hybridized entertainer!","review":"Pretty much every movie critic has ripped this film apart and called it \"highly avoidable.\"  I, on the other hand refute all of them.  Why? The answer is simple.  I paid $8 to watch this movie, and never during the 3 hour span of the film was I ever bored.  It entertained me for every second of those 3 hours that I watched it.  It should be obvious that this is not meant to be some serious, thought-provoking classic.  It is meant solely to entertain.  And as part of Indian cinema, extensive hybridization of a film is absolutely necessary to entertain an undifferentiated audience, which this film has the capability of doing.  It has action when needed (although the scenes are flicked right out of John Woo's \"Face Off\"), it has some great comedy through a fabulous performance by Juhi Chawla, and some wonderful music and a kickass background score by A.R. Rahman.  Shahrukh and Jackie are very competent in their roles.  The movie is pure escapism and to provide that, the director Shashilal Nair does a decent job.  It is extremely surprising why this film flopped and why critics took the film so seriously and denounced it completely.  I mean come on, cut the entertainers some slack and enjoy the movie.  Not every movie you critics watch absolutely HAS to be a work of art.  Just take it in as what it is.  Free your mind a little.","imdb_rating":8,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" Spectacular Movie!!!!","review":"One 2 Ka 4 is an awesome movie! It has everything one could ask for... action, comedy, romance; One 2 Ka 4 has it all! Juhi was so funny throughout the entire movie, especially in the beginning like when she accidentally sticks a fork into Shahrukh's hand, it left me laughing like crazy! Juhi did an excellent job playing her role. It amazed me how she \"transformed\" from an over talkative Punjabi girl, to club dancer to an undercover cop! Even Shahrukh shined throughout the film!As for the songs, I'd have to say One 2 Ka 4 has a very interesting soundtrack. This film offers a wide variety of music ranging from a romantic number like \"Sona Nahi Na Sahi\" to a catchy dance number like \"Osaka Muraiya.\" One 2 Ka 4's soundtrack is beyond amazing!I really wonder why critics considered One 2 Ka 4 a \"flop\" and put it down so much? I think One 2 Ka 4 is a totally cool movie and far from being boring!Overall, One 2 Ka 4 deserves a 10/10!!!","imdb_rating":10,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" Good performances, dodgy plot","review":"One Two Ka Four starts out as a rather unoriginal, Hollywood inspired buddy-cop picture, but is saved from being totally mundane by the performances of its stars, and a couple of nice story twists. Just don't think too hard about the plot, or you might fall through some of the gigantic holes. Shah Rukh Khan is perfect as a kid-hating, shoot-first-ask-questions-later cop, and Jackie Shroff is excellent (as always) as his older partner. Juhi Chawla provides most of the comedy with her character.Just when I started getting bored with the cliche'd Hollywood-style action, the story turned into a neat little family drama, with Shah Rukh and Juhi playing nursemaid to a bunch of bratty kids. I thought it was entertaining and charming.The A.R. Rahman music is trite in places, but features some really outstanding numbers, too, especially the comic \"I'm Sorry\" number with SRK and Juhi and the kids, and the lovely and romantic \"Sona Nahi Nah Sahi.\"This isn't a great film, it's true, but it entertained me for two and a half hours. I can't ask for more than that!","imdb_rating":0,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" An Brilliant movie!","review":"I loved this movie!!!! It had everything that I liked, comedy, action, sad moments, the plot was great. if your probably reading this then you probably think that i'm the type of person who likes practically anything with Shahrukh in it, but your wrong, I do dislike some other movies, for e.g. Kabhie Kushie Kabhie Gham, Kal Ho Na Ho, and others. Juhi was spectacular, every time she was on the screen at the start of the movie she made me laugh! Shahrukh had his moments that would make you want to laugh to and acted perfectly at the sad moments. Jackie was great too!!! The music, as soon as I watched the movie I immediately went out and purchased the sound track, on CD, it's amazing!!!! Like Mastana said, don't believe what the critics say about movies, just because they didn't like it doesn't mean that everyone has too, at the end of the day who are they to influence our decisions no matter what it is! Also I would like them to make a film, and see how other critics bad mouth their movie.","imdb_rating":10,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" oh my god what where these people thinking!","review":"One two ka four is quite simply the most atrocious,hacknyed,and forgettable film i have ever seen.First of all,not only does this film heavily \"borrow\" from other western films,it displays absolutely no originality.This film was sheepishly contstructed,and obviously very little time and effort was put into this project.Anyone can easily find errors in continuity and realism. One need look no further than the opening action scene as an example,where a criminal who is dead,is shown in one shot to have his hands on his chest,and in another angle shot, rest his hands on the ground! This just scratches the surface of all the improbabilities of this film.The script is a hash of cliches and fails miserabley to develop any of the one-dimensional characters. The villian \"KKV\" deserves particular recognition for poor acting,as he is far too cartoonish and unbelievable. The music just seems odd and always out of place. Overall,even by Indian standards,One two ka four is a very poorly made film. For anyone who has seen the film,this thought should be amusing for you: what would happen if a film like one two ka four was made in Hollywood?","imdb_rating":1,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" I expected a better film","review":"One 2 Ka Four is not that bad. But it's a disappointment from a director of Shashilal Nair's caliber. The only highlight of this film was the pairing of SRK and Juhi Chawla. Shahrukh Khan seemed lost in a somewhat unconventional script that demanded a lot of histrionics and yelling and screaming. Juhi Chawla was believable as the bubbly, fun loving girl-next- door but fails to leave a mark as an intelligent undercover cop. This is one of her many films where she gets to display her comic skills and she does it surprisingly well. The story of One 2 Ka Four resembles the story of One Good Cop. And this is quite sad that an intelligent filmmaker like Nair would resort to ripping out a B grade Hollywood thriller. Jackie Shroff in a small role looks jaded and is quickly forgotten after the intermission. Nirmal Pandey cannot act, that is quite apparent. Raj Zutsi looks bland. Overall, it's a below average flick!","imdb_rating":0,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" A mismatch","review":"Commercial films mostly try to meet everyone's demands But sometimes it leads to a hotchpotch Even though this film is better then many Srk films yet it somehow faltersThe film starts off well, Jackie's Murder is a nice turning point but then the scenes shift to scenes with kids, to romance and only towards the end does Srk try to find out the real murdererThe film gets boring in between due to the mis focus The last few minutes are brilliantly handled but there are many flaws like How does Juhi land in 2 places at one time? many more tooDirection by Shashilal Nair is decent in parts Music is okaySRK does his level best, he is very good in serious scenes and hope to see him in such roles which require him not just to cry and ham Juhi does a good job Amongst rest Nirmal Pandey overacts so badly that you feel like killing him, Raj Jhutsi too overacts The kids are okay Jackie Shroff is alright in a cameo","imdb_rating":4,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0}],"imdbId":"tt0227194"}
