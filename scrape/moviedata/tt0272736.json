But having watched the movie it became evident that though it was from the Yash Chopra banner, it was not a Yash Chopra movie. Don't get me wrong here, it's a movie worth watching  great picturisation, good songs, nice clothes, foreign locations, a love triangle and a young & hip cast. BUT it is not much different from the other run-of-the-mill love stories, and nothing makes it standout from the crowd as a Yash Chopra venture would have.The story is simple (but a little flawed at times)  three friends grow up in a small town in India, but Raj moves away to the UK with his parents. He sends regular emails to Tina, but unknowingly gets responses from Pooja. Through these responses he falls for the girl he thinks is Tina, but in reality is Pooja. When he finally realizes the truth, tragedy strikes and peoples morals are tried and tested and true love wins.\nRani looks fab. She is the embodiment of a sexy lady. She dresses very well, can relate to the character and acts very naturally. Kareena is all Kareena and what we have come to expect from her. She is very well suited to the crazy, bratty girl (remember Po from K3G) but falls flat on her face when it comes to emotional and challenging roles. Hrithik is good in the role and has done the role some justice. Support staffs are just part of the background. The songs are good and with the times, however the mixed medley is really good to see, we should definitely have more of them in movies to come. Overall an entertaining movie, but definitely not a classic or a milestone in Indian cinema.","imdb_rating":0,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" I absolutely love this movie! One of my favorites.","review":"I feel the title is perfect for the movie. The story line is brilliant. Real emphasis on how deep friendship goes and also sacrifices that you will make for friends and loved ones, as well as honoring the value of friendship even when they have passed on. The fact that money and riches didn't change them as people but in fact made the bond of friendship stronger, I felt was good. Brings forth good upbringing, values, morals and great respect for elders. Also respect that the parents have for their children by allowing them freedom of choice. It is a light-hearted movie but also intense in some scenes, which I loved. Great dialogue and brilliant performances from the entire cast. Lovely songs and the dancing was very good. Definitely a must see and also to add to your collection.","imdb_rating":10,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" Chef Kunal Kohli's recipe prepared exclusively for CANDYFLOSS, the Chopra chain of restaurants, is recommended only for the sweet-film toothed","review":"Here's presenting the recipe of MUJHSE DOSTI KAROGE prepared by Chef KUNAL KOHLI exclusively for CANDYFLOSS, the CHOPRA chain of restaurants: Borrow the basic story idea from DTPH (or any triangular love story). Use a dash of KKHH in the first half and SAAJAN in the second. Some glimpses of DDLJ as per taste. Take Kareena's entry and her father's death sequences from K3G. Add the MAINE PYAR KIYA inspired song parody sequence and end it hurriedly, inspired from K2H2 again. Add the regular YASH CHOPRA sauces i.e. melodious music and cool choreography. Garnish it with foreign locales, jazzy costumes and grandeur sets. MDK is ready. The CHOPRA restaurant also gives you an extra papad (Uday Chopra) free of cost.So the story is about 3 friends, who are separated in their childhood. Raj (Hrithik) shifts to London and from there mails regularly to Tina (Kareena), who isn't much interested in replying. All those emails are replied by Pooja (Rani) but under the name of Tina (Well I suppose the net wasn't introduced in India about 15 years from now). Raj comes to India and gradually falls in love with Tina, but when he realizes that all those letters were written by Pooja his heart suddenly flips over towards her in less than a second (like they say, Hrithik Ki Tarah, o sorry, girgit Ki Tarah rang badal na). Then starts the triangle. Finally friends become lovers and lovers become friends. And when it comes to Hindi cinema, there isn't much difference between the two terms.Film-critic-turned-director Kunal Kohli handles many sequences with sensitivity but relies too heavily on the tried and tested stuff. Like the climax that shows a pinch full of sindoor falling on Rani's forehead appears way too clichéd. Moreover Words like farz, vaada, saccha pyar, qurbani are bandied about so many times that they lose their significance.Finally the movie clearly belongs to Rani Mukherjee who has the meatiest role comparatively and does full justice to it. Hrithik is good but suffers from Shahrukh hangover at times. Kareena's role is just an extension of what she did in K3G.Recommended only for the sweet-film toothed.","imdb_rating":5,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" Heart warming","review":"Usually I'm the first to criticise Indian movies for their lack of storyline, songs & attempts to rip of most films from English/European speaking backgrounds. However this movie pleasantly surprised me, finally a movie that actually made sense (although a lil' predictable) about the connection between love and marrying your soulmate. Hrithik Roshan is convincing as the heart torn Raj & Rani Mukherjee definitely is fantastic as the best friend/soulmate Pooja. I think the purpose of Kareena Kapoor was to show some skin and that Indians have some style. Well too be honest I highly doubt that other Indians would seriously walk around in skimpy clothing without first being burnt at the stake!There was chemistry between Hrithik & Rani which made the storyline more convincing, and you truly felt for them right up til' the very end of the movie.One huge flaw- Stop using the names Raj/Tina/Pooja, don't Indians have any other names?","imdb_rating":10,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" Nothing new here, but entertains nevertheless.","review":"Mujhse Dosti Karoge is a romantic flick that guarantees to give the audience the quality in the banner of Yash Copra production. Raj (Hrithik Roshan), Pooja (Kareena Kapoor) and Tina (Kareena Kapoor) are friends since childhood. Raj always has a crush to Tina, even he and his family must leave to London, he keep send Tina e-mail. But, the ultra-chick Tina doesn't have any mood to replying it, so she gives the task to Pooja. So, all the times, in 15 years, Pooja keep writing email to Raj by the name of Tina. The love triangle comes as result, when eventually Raj coming back to Simla. From here, we've already know where is the film going to, even when the film hasn't started yet. Notwithstanding of that, Mujhse Dosti Karoge is a slick and hip product. The tension that the film offer is builds the mood of the viewers. Just don't expect any new story here. Just prepare your self to be entertains in a romantic ways, and you'll get the expectation. 7/10","imdb_rating":7,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" An irritating retell of an old story....","review":"The plot is one that has been told so many times before in Indian Cinema, and sadly, this adaption of the story, to be honest, sucks.Hrithik Roshan does a fairly good job as his character, Raj. However, he overacts for basically half the film. Rani was wasted.,. Kareena Kapoor, another wasted actor - she could have done much better. Apart from exposure, a few crying sequences, a couple of songs, and looking pretty, Kareena also had barely anything to display. This film is not one of Kunal Kohli's better ones. He did a much better job with Hum Tum.Oh well, I guess we all make mistakes....","imdb_rating":0,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" true love conquers over all","review":"this movie was a really nice movie! rani did an awesome job playing Pooja. She was basically the star in this movie. this movie has similarities to Kuch Kuch Hota Hai. Tina portrays Tina, Rahul portrays Raj,and Anjali portrays Pooja and Aman Mehra portrays Rohan. The only difference is that rani comes back and plays the character that closely resembles Anjali's character from Kuch Kuch Hota Hai(she was Tina in Kuch Kuch Hota Hai),instead of Shahrukh khan we have Hrithik Roshan,and instead of Rani playing tina in MDK...Kareena plays her. The song Kuch Kuch Hota Hai is in the medly,one of the songs in the movie.The thing i dont understand is why Raj didnt fall in love w/Pooja at first. She was the one who always loved him.","imdb_rating":0,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" Yashraj and Hrithik's first flop together","review":"Yashraj is considered to be the most prime bollywood production house but however their few films are really notable. Mujhse Dosti Karoge released in 2002 starring Hrithik Roshan who was still trying to gain his foothold, he had a superhit debut but post that his career was going downhill, this film took it further down Kareena was going through a repetitive Poo Phase while Rani too was struggling. The film like most Yashraj films is shot abroad, larger then life sets, characters are dressed stylishly whether there are poor or rich. This film was also directed by Kunal Kohli who was a film critic before perhaps after watching this film he would never criticise a film again. The storyline is pretty ordinary, Raj, Pooja and Tina are childhood friends played by Hrithik Rani and Kareena respectively, Raj goes abroad but promises that he will keep in touch through internet(in 1992, 10 years since the film is set). How realistic YRF films are!!!!! Anywayz when they get old after years, Raj comes back The twist in the tale is it was Rani's character chatting with Hrithik whom he mistakes to be Kareena and then some typical song n dance till the twist is revealed. The film follows a predictable format and has clichés and melodrama. Nothing really worthwhile to speak about. The director also adds Uday Chopra as the second lead, the Salman Khan kinda character from Kuch Kuch Hota Hai. The climax is perhaps the worst climaxes in a love triangleDirection is nothing great, thank god Kunal gave us Hum Tum after 2 years Music was typical Yrf, though Jaane Dil Mein is decent, the medley leaves a lot to be desiredHrithik Roshan was repeating himself, film after film except Mission Kashmir, FIZA though he plays well in emotional scenes yet he needed a makeover Rani Mukherjee gets the meatiest part and does a good job Kareena Kapoor was getting irritating with her same Poo act she did over and over again, she gets also the lesser role Uday Chopra gets a sidey role and is nothing great Kiran Kumar, Satish Shah and others are okay","imdb_rating":3,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" A great film!","review":"Mujhse Dosti Karoge tells the story of three childhood friends Raj, Tina and Pooja.

His quality acting can be prove in this movie.\nBut to bad Bollywood's always made simple happy ending, not like Hollywood's. I like this movie, but can they make Kareena not giving up so fast and very easy. Because I'm boring with simple ending and without sadness knowing that Hritik love her best friend.","imdb_rating":6,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" It's about t9ime!!!!!!!","review":"Its about time Rani Mukherjee finally gets the man!!! She plays such sympathetic \"good\" characters but also gets left at the altar or takes second best.The musical and dance medley near the end of the movie was superb. (IMDB should include a list of the songs used in trivia or movie connections.) An Indian friend told me she used to dance to these songs when younger.The romantic plot is typical Bollywood but with an interesting modern twist. I must admit I would be getting tired of these plots if it were not for the music and dance numbers which I love. It takes great plot, great acting, great music and great dancing to make a great Bollywood movie. I know that the actors and actresses do not usually do their own singing, but they must do their own dancing - and what dancers. Unlike in the United States I guess you have to be a great actor and a great dancer to make it in India as a star.","imdb_rating":9,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" A disgrace!","review":"The film is like all other Bollywood films. A love triangle that ends in a happy marriage. But that's not what I am going to talk about. It's going to be about the role Satish Shah plays in the movie.If the director wants to show a Sikh family in the movie, fine. I understand that showing other religions, like Hindus, in other parts of India, like Gujju-land, may not be as presentable as a Sikh family in Punjab, but showing Sikh family practicing Hindu worship is not! Sikhs do not worship idols. Sikhs only believe in one God, equality of man kind and dignity for all. This is what their they mean when they wear a turban and beard. This movie disgraces this dignity of Sikhs! This movie is yet another example of the media attack on Sikhi. This portrayal of a Sikh family was wrong and should be apologized for.","imdb_rating":1,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" Worst Film Ever","review":"Worst Film And OverActing That's Way Film Is Big Flop At Box Office.","imdb_rating":0,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" too run of the mill! in one word, BORING!!!","review":"i just dont know when india will get sick and tired of such teeny bopper, chewing gum romances. its just astonishing that weve been churning out so many such movies since eons. also, the look of the film is also the same ole one. manish malhotra at work. manish, we want something fresh now. enough of the old stuff.","imdb_rating":2,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" Avoid at all cost..........listen to the music though.","review":"I am a big fan of Hrithik Roshan, and I think he is the best actor ever. I love all of his films except for this one and Main Prem Ki Diwani Hoon. Which both are very similar. Both films are bad. But lets review Mujhe Se Dosti Karoge. I loved the music of mujhse Dosti Karoge. All songs are very melodious and fit well with each other. my favorite being Andehki Anjaani Si. The story, was nothing new, in fact it was very clichéd. The writer attempted a new style, but fell flat. The performances, the characterization was a huge drawback. Kareena's role was completely wasted. Her acting also was okay. Rani was good, but not great. Hrithik is a good actor, and tried his best, but the because of the disaster screenplay, and poor direction, Hrithik could not bring out his true potential. But he was still good. The length is also very long, I must say I watched this film twice and both times, I almost died from boredom. This film was was a flop at the box office. I see a lot of people praising this film. And I see nobody praising good films of Hrithik's like Aap Mujhe Achche Lagne lage and Na tum jano na hum, which were released the same year as Mujhse Dosti Karoge but also flopped. Those films were amazing, and Mujhse Dosti karoge is trash compared to those films. Take my advice, as a hrithik fan watch his every film, except for this one. listen to the songs though.","imdb_rating":4,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" same old same old","review":"MUJHSE DOSTI KAROGE -And once again after a decent gap of a couple of months we are taken back into the magical world of yash chopra movies.....the alps, the women in chiffon, the wonderful bonds of family and friendship and the same story repeated over and over again...Mujhse Dosti Karoge tries to be different.....honestly it does. It focusses on the friendship and subsequent love triangle of three childhood pals.....Raj, Tina and Pooja. As one of them pithily puts it......pyar dosti hai....oh wait sorry that was dil to pagal hai. Moving on....so mdk has this cool triangle between the scantily clad - nisha, the chopra version of the bharatiya nari - pooja and the gap clad - rahul.....oops that was also dil to pagal hai but you get the drift. Since the plot is redundant let's talk exciting stuff like this wonderful pseudo antakshari routine between sridevi, anil kapoor and anupam kher......my bad that was lamhe. Okay song picturisations then.....shot beautifully atop snow-clad mountains ( like every yash chopra movie since 1988), around the red telephone boxes and escalators of london ( see ddlj and k3g for more details) and an exciting on stage number (see kkhh for a slight but better variation on the same). Since nothing else is particularly new.....let's talk climax which features this awesome concept of the big man on top......yes God himself dropping in to sort matters out.....and there's this cute family dog....no no that's hahk....ok well mdk climax is hahk without the dog. Well atleast kunal kohli moved on to steal ideas from another banner instead of sticking with yash raj traditions.MDK is not a bad movie but it's a movie we've all seen over and over again in some form or the other. The fact that it liberally borrows ideas from other famous yash raj produced movies does not help since all of the other movies are close to classics with characters, songs and sequences that still resonate with movie-goers. Even the English original, The Truth about Cats and Dogs which itself is inspired from Cyrano de Bergerac was no Oscar contender....but it was a well made romantic comedy exuding warmth and goodness which is something one cannot say for MDK.The story is nothing to write home about, neither are the songs, the direction, the cinematography or even the acting. Kareena plays a watered down version of Poo, Rani plays a longer version of the saintly but soon dead Tina and Hrithik, well he does what he's being paid pots of money to do - exude charisma, shake a shapely leg or two and twinkle at the ladies. The biggest pity is these are all actors who are capable of much more, yet they settle for poor copies of roles they themselves have played before. And that's perhaps is the final word on MDK itself. It's a poor copy of movies made before by the same production house and that's a huge pity because the banner itself is capable of so much more.So do you watch it.......i wouldn't reccomend it.....go rent ddlj, kkhh, hahk even qsqt and mpk and see what romance is truly about.....why settle for a cheap copy when the original is just a movie rental away","imdb_rating":0,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" Brilliant movie!!!!","review":"I have seen this movie over 30 times. Love it each time!\nHritihk Roshan's acting is Superb !\nPar excellent!!!Brilliant!!!!","imdb_rating":10,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" Fun but at times infuriating","review":"***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** 'Mujhse Dosti Karogi' is typically a teen movie. If this were a Hollywood movie it would have most likely starred someone like Freddie Prinze Jr. or Sarah Michelle Gellar or both. The only difference being that they can actually (just) pass off being in their late teens, early twenties.All in all this movie is quite entertaining. The story revolves around three teens, Raj, Pooja and Tina, who are seperated when Raj leaves with his parents to Britain. Raj has a crush on Tina and stays in contact with her through e-mail. Tina is bored with Raj, so smitten Pooja e-mails Raj in Tina's name. After a decade or so, Raj returns and the problems ensue. Pooja doesn't want to admit she wrote the e-mails, but it doesn't matter anyway, because Raj falls head over heels with the much more beautiful Tina. [Personally, I think Pooja (Rani Mukherjee) is much hotter than Tina (Kareena Kapoor)]. Until of course he finds out that Pooja wrote the emails.First of all, let me say I loved Rani in this movie. Her character was truly endearing. Which made it even worse she ended up with a schmuck like Hritik, who falls in and out of love at the drop of a hat and manages to blaim everything on the person who has loved him his entire life. *POSSIBLE SPOILER* When he reproaches Pooja for lying to him, because he is really in love with her, I wanted to smack him. But naturally Pooja wouldn't just roll over and gave him good by telling him that he's the one who didn't recognise her as the person who had been sending the emails. After all, he had told her that when they would meet his heart would recognise hers... aaahhh...As far as the acting goes, like I said, Rani was brilliant. Hritik was so so. It's quite remarkable that whenever Hritik tries to display emotions like anger or grief, he looks like his eyes are about to pop out of his head, his head is then gonna explode and he wants to smack someone elses head into a wall. I much rather prefer Shah Rukh Khan who when displaying grief or anger stays admirably calm and controlled and turns on the puppy dog eyes. As far as Kareena is concerned, her acting is good except she comes across as a real lightbulb, as usual. But I would like to give her the benefit of the doubt. Perhaps her character Tina is a lightbulb, in which case Kareena's acting was really good. All in all, this movie is quite enjoyable, if you don't mind a Bollywood teen movie. It would have been nice if it had a more original ending, for instance if Rani in the end fell madly in love with Uday Chopra and let Hritik and Kareena make each other miserable.**/5 stars","imdb_rating":0,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" Rani Saheba saves the day.","review":"Only one dress one beautiful makeup and one scene in the church is so goddanm intense you can literally feel rani's heartbeat.

Another minor gripe was that we were supposed to find Pooja to be nowhere near as beautiful as Tina, but Rani Mukherjee is stunning and and this concept was a little too unbelievable.Hrithik Roshan has battled the critics for the past two years aside from K3G  and has finally netted another decent role to perform and this should restore him to \"Not Finished Status\" He is a decent actor, and I would be hard pressed to identify anyone else in Bollywood that can dance as well, his movements are as graceful and natural as any man can muster - He is the human slinky!Kareena although named Tina (Swapping her K3G name, for Rani's KKHH name) manages to bring back her Pooja role from K3G and until the last reel is note very appealing in anything other than physically, the character finally starts doing some things that show a little depth later in the film and by the end you actually like her. (Providing you aren't Amisha Patel).Rani Mukherjee has finally been given a major role that she deserves, no, she isn't the acting genius that her cousin Kajol has proven to be, but that doesn't keep her from continuously delivering solid performances, regardless of the size of the role and screen time. This film is no exception. Rani plays the role very well and she seems to be headed to being a big star. As people may know, Rani is a sweet person who can't manage to say anything bad about anyone and I wish her all the best, she deserves it.So if you are an actor, your father is the producer and your brother is a screen writer, do you think you will find trouble getting a role, of course not, Uday Chopra comes into the movie halfway through and while I really want to like him and his performance, I find that every time Uday is onscreen, in this film or others, he looks like he is having too much fun, In other words, he looks like he is acting rather than getting lost in his character like the other performers. This sometimes is distracting and brings down a scene. I think that eventually someone will clue him onto this fact and he will become much more believable. But note until the day that someone has the nerve to tell the son of one of the most successful men in Mumbai...Great soundtrack, In some of the musical numbers choreography seemed nonexistent, but other scenes such as the Medley of Chopra hits were done very well.Overall the movie was fun, I would give it a 7.5 out of 10, while not perfect, it was an enjoyable film and perhaps will get the critics to chup chup (Shut up) about Hrithik for a while.","imdb_rating":8,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" Kareena and Rani","review":"Worst film. Kareena Kapoor and Rani Mukherjee always in pant-shirts in this movie. They both look good in pant-shirts.In most of the songs all actors wear pant-shirts. All the actresses wear colorful pants. Kareena is most time in jeans and t-shirts. While Rani appears in jeans and trousers also. They both want to defeat each other in this film.Kareena looks so good in red pant. Rani looks so good in yellow pant. They both looks so good as Hemamalini in films 'trishul' and 'joshila'. In these films Hema also wear pant-shirts for most of the times. She also looks so good.

Yes,Hritik is currently the best actor in Bombay and he always puts good an effort in a role play for example-Aap Mujhe Achche Lagne Lage. I love watching him when he acts,as I see..he looks more outstanding! Nowadays he's the best actor i have ever seen after Shahrukh Khan.I may say so Hritik is the one actor who becomes popular in Bombay. But the ***spoiler*** here in this film is Rani Mukherjeee..\"SPOILER\" see,she absolutely doesn't match with Hritik..I watched it many times and I was realized while Rani's acting as a Pooja with Hritik she seemed more an awkward and she's thunderous because she never acts with hritik before..and i wanna say again..she does not match with Hritik anyway,that's the point!What's up with Rani? So the conclusion is she should have played more stronger anyway or the best i think she shouldn't have acted with Hritik anymore! So has anyone seen Rani played film with Hritik afterward? For me,she has no attraction yet like the others actress have and she doesn't play well like the others actress do. what i could say about Kareena..yes she's hot and gorgeous girl and she plays well even though she's young-actress to take part more bollywood films by now. Rani is a person who has to be change in her style,character and changed how to play more stronger in others film next time! or might be not! She has no attraction i may thought!","imdb_rating":5,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" Enjoyable Romantic Drama","review":"As a young boy, Raj moves with his family to London. He asks his crush, Tina, to write to him. She says she will, but as she has no interest in so doing, their mutual friend Pooja writes to him instead, and in Tina's name, for fifteen years. After these fifteen years, Raj (Hrithik Roshan) returns to India, halfway in love with the writer of the letters. When Tina (Kareena Kapoor) turns out tobe so beautiful and bubbly, Raj is certain that he loves her, not realizing that Pooja (Rani Mukherjee), who loves him, is the letter writer and the one he truly loves.The plot is standard Bollywood fare, but is good nonetheless. The chemistry between Roshan and Mukherjee is excellent--so good it's palpable at times. The loves songs were good, and the group choreography pleasant to watch. Kapoor's costumes, while fitting for her character, were so skimpy as to be almost painful to see. This film works it way up to a tremendous ending, but instead it ties up too nicely and quickly. This keeps it from being an exceptional movie, but it is overall good entertainment.","imdb_rating":7,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" Chopras conveyor belt keeps a runnin","review":"The film is just as you expect - No great shakes but an entertaining 2 and a half hours.
