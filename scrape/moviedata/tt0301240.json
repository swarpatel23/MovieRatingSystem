Moksha shows us what Rampal's capable of!","review":"Arjun Rampal, \"the unlucky guy\" as I do refer to him as for all his films bomb at the Box Office... but why is he so under rated as an actor? Moksha came during the beginning of his career and trust me, if you like Rampal or you hate Rampal, if you're a serious film-watcher, watch Moksha... and it will all change.The guy, literally carries the movie and gives the best performance till date. The music is tremendous... Jaanleva is still a favorite till date... The action scenes are well executed...The direction is superb. Moksha is not for the typical Indian Audience who would only like the Johar flicks but if you've like those good movies like Rang De Basanti, Dil Chahta Hai, Lagaan, Swades or Lakshya for that sake, you'll love Moksha. Moksha literally takes us for a ride into the character, Vikram Sehgal's mind... Rampal makes you believe that he IS Vikram Sehgal.The movie shows every aspect of his character right from his concern for the poor, his hatred against the system, his dilemma and his guilt...I cannot reveal the story but all I gotta say is that if Rampal gets the right movies and the right Director, he got potential even if his movies do bomb at the B.O.... here's looking forward to Don...","imdb_rating":10,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" Moksha- The Salvation","review":"Director- Ashok Maheta *Arjun Rampal, Manisha KoiralaSimply brilliant! Moksha is a thinking man's dream film. Ashok Mehta done great job.Starring Arjun Ramphal and Manisha Koirala, Mehta's Moksha is an artistic look at the psychological trauma imposed on a good-natured man's mind by an uncaring and selfish world leading him to social deviance and despair. Arjun Rampal's best performance has been in this film, the way his frustration has been shown through eyes of anger is absolute world class. It's sad that he never performed so well in his life, the way he did in this film. . He is excellent in the dramatic scenes and is quite the natural with his facial expressions an emoting. I think he deserved best actor award that year. This film is honestly one of the most underrated films of Bollywood but a real treat to watch! So please folks. Do me a favor and please don't ignore this beautiful piece of art. It's not a perfect film, but it's just so good. It's evident why this movie is hitting the Film Festival circuit (It was recently screened at the Cairo Film Festival as well as the Locarno Film Festival). The film even picked up two National Awards at this year's ceremonies. So don't listen to some of lame-brained, intelligence-impaired, self-proclaimed trade analysts who gave this film the rotten review treatment. They wouldn't know a good film if it ran up behind them and bit them (You critics listening?). You'll be happy for it, believe me! Moksha is an excellent film. I can't stand it when an excellent film goes unnoticed. But hey, that's the Indian Film Industry for you.9/10","imdb_rating":10,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" SalVation","review":"Hello,Since I bought Moksha sometime last year I wanted to see it. So today I made time to see it. After the movie I kicked and punched myself, for not watching it sooner. This movie won national award for Cinematography and Audiography. This movie reminded me of Memento. Different camera angles were used and overused which were sometimes distracting. The music was not impressive but went well with the story. There was pacing problems in some part of the movie especially the first half. The casting was perfect!!! Lots of symbolism used in the movie. I liked the use of black & white to portray present and color to potray past(flashback). I also liked the dream sequences.

Director has done a wonderful job but the USP of the movie is Arjun Rampal... I feel he should do more films like Moksh instead of doing all second lead crap...He is a smart guy and a potential actor with a very manly voice. He must do more of this kind of movies. Black and white scenes are amazingly done and worth watching on big screen. Most of people complained that it was too slow but i feel that's what the story demands that you understand each and every moment of the hardship our hero is going through. One of the best in it's class i was completely satisfied","imdb_rating":8,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" A perfect depiction of borderline personality disorder.","review":"I have yet to see a more perfect, artistic, and beautiful depiction of borderline personality disorder. Too bad, Ashok Mehta didn't directed more films. Cinematography is on par with world standards. If not for any other reason, watch for cinematography alone. Arjun Rampal is dead sexy in this film and more than in any of his future film. This is not meant for everyone! Only people who have experienced extreme emotional states(whether you see this thing as good or bad), can truly understand this film.","imdb_rating":10,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" Very Different for Bollywood ***Major Spoilers*","review":"Director: Ashok Mehta Starring: Arjun Rampal, Manisha KoiralaRating: 7 out of 10The film is definitely very different and thought provoking. But my love affair with this movie wasn't a very smooth one. I actually was bored out of my mind during the first forty minutes. It's only after that, that I became engrossed in the storyline and I began to understand why certain portions of the film was in black and white and why some previously hard-to-understand scenes occurred. After the initial hesitation at the beginning, I must say I really enjoyed this flick. The story is about how a disillusioned lawyer Vikram Sehgal (Arjun Rampal) decides that he must stop being selfish and be more concerned about the poor man. So he tries to set up a new court where poor men can have their cases looked at in a fair manner. But it becomes so hard to set up and Arjun becomes so obsessed about trying to make a success of it. But little does he realise, that by trying to make a go of this scheme, he becomes an even more selfish and hypocritical human being...This is a very symbolic movie full of metaphors and symbols. But I enjoyed figuring out the symbols a lot! :) This is a very thought-provoking film, which refreshingly has a hero with real gray shades. He reminded me of Christian Bale's character in American Psycho (though Bale had to portray a much nastier anti-hero). What I found interesting was the way Vikram is cold towards his girlfriend Ritika Sanyal (Manisha Koirala). He loves her with passion but at the same time he is also cruelly aloof. In one scene, the lead characters go climbing to get to the top of a cliff. When Vikram gets to the top, he decides to let out his frustrations and kicks a rock off the cliff and just let it fall to the bottom. But Ritika is still climbing up the hill and as the rock tumbles downhill, it nearly hits her (but it doesn't). It suddenly strikes us that he does not care about his girlfriend much, he is too self-involved in his own frustrations that he doesn't care whether Ritika gets hurt or not.Performances are hit and miss. Manisha is terrible in the beginning but she improves when the plot gets going. It's as if she suddenly realised that the movie is a decent one and started to put effort into her acting. Manisha is very good in one scene where she confronts her Arjun after he calls her khudgarz. She cries because she has done so much for him and she still is called khudgarz. I found that scene moving. Arjun is OK, he is good when he is angry and when he has to project the cold element of his character. In other scenes, he is simply expressionless. But I still wouldn't trade him for a different actor, if I were to reshoot the film, I would just make him work harder on his acting. His character is very psychological. He is likeable but at the same time he is also very sadistic to the people he loves in the film and some viewers may hate him for that. Naseeruddin Shah's cameo as the increasingly confused journalist was good.\nThe direction is excellent, Ashok Mehta does have potential. He excels with the black and white scenes. Rampal's character does literally nothing except just let water splash over him but even in these scenes, Mehta has the knack of making them compelling. The way he films the scene where Vikram drops Ritika into the sea is just mindblowing!! It is so unexpected, you think that he will accidentally drop her into the water and try to save her. But no, he just lets her slide out of her arms and as the poor girl falls into the water, we get a close up of Vikram's face, which looks away. He looks so cold there and his eyes have that suitably icy expression. The final scene where the bank robbery occurs, it is marvellously directed because Mehta just shows the feet of the people in the bank and as they walk about quickly or run, you know that there is panic and chaos in the bank. And I liked the imagery that Mehta constantly uses with water and money. I don't quite know what the significance of water was meant to be. But I think it was supposed to represent humanity. The water can be clean but just like Arjun Rampal's character, it can also become dirty when mixed with other elements like sand or mud. It can also become cold and turn into ice (the imagery of ice is also used in this movie) signifying the cold feelings of the hero.But the movie is not without its flaws. I found the dream sequence of Manisha's character very laughable. What on earth was she wearing?! She wears something very weird, which unfortunately turns her into a laughing stock. In this scene, the movie began to get a little too pretentious and too arty. So many things were happening and you have to admit that the sets were a bit dodgy. And the music, though sweet (like \"Nanimaa\") is almost forgettable. I like two songs Seep Main Moti and Humko Pyaar Hai and they have very good picturisations. I liked Jaan Leva a lot too but my craze for that song has worn off.","imdb_rating":7,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" Marginally worth watching but only once","review":"Moksha is a classial example of an Indian movie that lacks originality and attempts to show a sequence of events in a Hollywood style. The movie is basically about a law graduate (arjun rampal) who studied law because of his passion towards helping those who cannot help themselves. Money was never an incentive for him to practice law. This dogma of life caused problems between him and his father (oberoi) because his father was a money motivated person and resented his son for his way of thinking. Further into the movie, he meets and falls in love with a naive, vulnerable but good looking young girl (manisha) and they begin to spend a lot of time together. Eventually, he begins to confide in her. After witnessing injustice at a local village where several impoverished people underwent a momentous amount of suffering, he decides to open up a charity foundation for the poor and needy. However acknowledging the need for funding, he explores all possible \"legal\" avenues but fails to get the funds. Even his father turns his back on him. This compels him to use illegal methods to obtain the required funds and during the course of doing so, he begins to turn insane. So thats the plot of the movie. The problem with this movie is that it mimics the Hollywood style of direction (i.e. the black and white flashbacks and the obscure dream) and overall seems very illogical. The plot however was very good in my opinion, but unfortunately, the movie failed to demonstrate it effectively.If you like movies like \"phir teree kahani yaad aye\", \"Daddy\", \"Jo Jetee howee sikandar\", then Moksha is a below average movie.However, if you are crazy about Indian movies and relish watching all kinds of junk, then Moksha is a great movie. I give it ** / ***** (2/5 stars)","imdb_rating":0,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" A movie before its time!","review":"Moksha was the launching pad for Arjun Rampal and was first directorial debut of then famous cinematographer. The movie is excellent is every respect. Be it the story, the camera work, the background score; However, it was made ahead of its time. If it was made these days where experimental and substance movies are being recognized, it would have worked well with the audience. Nevertheless, I recommened this movie those people who appreciate quality cinema.","imdb_rating":8,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" This movie should have been the only Hindi movie I have seen","review":"The movie is good, and its a picture of my mind(may not be of others) , but every person on earth today should watch this movie once at least, they may fast forward and rewind if they want, but see it for sure. That's all I can say. I still watch it as an inspiration. Angels have send this movie (for me at least).Once in my dream, Sanat Kumara(I think his fallen part was Lucifer) meant , it was his story. if you are young and since Indian system suggests Brahmcharya, the only movie you should watch before marriage is this.Although I still have to find a movie that beautifies my thoughts about opposite sex.","imdb_rating":10,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0}],"imdbId":"tt0301240"}
