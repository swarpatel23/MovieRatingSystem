I don't know why stalwarts Amitabh and Zeenat chose to act in such a movie.  The direction is completely pathetic. All the actors are just rambling on whatever is in the \"script\" and are making no sense whatsoever.  They are mumbling jibber-jabbish, for a lack of anything better to do, that contain random multi-syllable English words in an effort to sound Western.  Random scenes of sex and violence are dropped in, and continuous use of vulgar language (like every sentence has f... in it) is used hoping to attract people to the theaters.  Money has been wasted on the most ridiculous things, such as using 400 carats of real diamonds, paying for accommodations in the world's most expensive hotel, and a special appearance by Bo Derek.  What is she doing in this movie?  She is in it for not more than five seconds.  Oh, I think someone forgot the story.  The \"plot\" has so many loopholes that it isn't supposed to make sense.  You're just supposed to watch the sex and enjoy listening to the f-word.  Whoever made this movie is a perverted psychopath.  He is trying his movie to look Hollywood, and as a result, looks like a complete idiot.","imdb_rating":1,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" Doom","review":"Good God. My eyes.. they still hurt..after being exposed to this movie. But the pain is mitigated, for my ears hurt even more, after having to listen to some of the most atrocious dialogue ever uttered.I'd like to consider myself to be fairly tolerant. I managed to sit through Kaante. Mind you, i did not enjoy the debacle in the least, but I could sit through it. Boom is downright repulsive and ridiculous. I walked into the theater with no expectation and still came out traumatized.I smelt trouble the moment one of the actors appeared on screen and for no rhyme or reason proceeded to say \"Tick tock,tick f**king, tock f**king tick\" in the most horrendous accent. After that it was all downhill.Acting - Unbelievable. The three models should be banned from acting. For some reason the director decided that it was best that they all put on weird accents. Almost all the dialogue is spoken in english. Apart from amitabh bachan , i can quite safely state that none of the other actors speak english. All the rest of the actors looked confused most of the time. I honestly can't blame them for being at the mercy of a screwball director.Dialogue -Downright annoying. Characters say random things, act like imbeciles on crack. The writer seems to be desperately trying to copy Tarantino's writing style. He comes closer to imitating a drunk moron who's vocabulary  doesn't exceed the F word. They use F**K generously and randomly. It never even sounds normal at any point, for all of them have such horrendous accents.Plot - Mind Numbingly bad. It doesnt even pretend to have one. Characters do random things for absolutely no rhyme or reason. Amitabh Bachan throws a female out of a moving car just for the heck of it. Zeenat's role in the movie is even more worse. There are no character arcs. The story is too absurd to be bothered about. To top it off there are plot holes the size of russia.Overview - The movie is annoying, disgusting, repulsive, childish, inane, moronic, absurd, incoherent, retarded,pointless, boring, embarassing.Those are its good qualities.Rating 2/10. What prevents me from giving it a one is the fact that it did have some decent cinematography and production values.","imdb_rating":1,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" THE WORST MOVIE EVER","review":"I had very high expectations when i went to see this movie. However i was utterly dissapointed. The movie is a no-go straight from frame 1. You always think that the film will pick-up, but it never happens. I had expected something fresh and different and a gripping story line, and ofcourse a few laughs...but believe me i never laughed once in the film. One of the major things i was dissapointed with was Amitabh's characterisation. He was really wasted.... i think he only ahd 4 to 5 scenes in the film....i dont know why he did this movie. All the models in the film dont know how to act....and the rest of the cast are ok. I think Javed Jaffry is the one who shows out. He was above average. Overall a very very bad movie....After Bombay Boys, Kaizad Gustad has made a very bad mistake making this big huge flop.... try harder next time....please!","imdb_rating":1,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" Boomerang","review":"Going to the movies is a wholesome experience for me. I look forward to the movie as soon I have my tickets booked. I have certain expectations from the movie and I switch off the outside world along with my cellphone as I settle in to watch the movie. This is how I settled down yesterday evening to watch this movie called Boom. The movie promised to have the elusive right mix of oomph and a real story coupled with good actors and behind it all a director who has been threatening to deliver for a long time. The spin-doctors had given good publicity to the movie by making sure that its every round to the censors was well publicised along with the usual comments on whatever happened to freedom of expression and self-censorship.The two hours of the movie passed in a whirl and it was difficult for me to conclude on what was worse- the movie or the audience. I for once pitied the censor board who has to see such junk like this in its raw form and then be criticised for censoring parts of the movie. I also came out of the movie with significant additions to my knowledge bank- I got to know, for example, that a bag of cement costs around 100 rupees or so and can be delivered the next day morning if it ordered around 7pm. How I know is because the person next to me was a cement dealer and obviously likes to conduct his business on the phone in a cinema hall when he is not whistling or nudging his partner everytime he saw a bikini on the screen. In addition, if I missed a double meaning dialogue in the movie then I only had to concentrate on the animated conversation behind me to hear it again amid a thousand giggles. With such wholesome entertainment all around me who wants to see the movie.\nNot that there was anything in the movie to watch. It's amazing how easily you can go wrong even if you put a bunch of talented actors on screen and some models who can also talk and a woman named Bo Derek thrown in for some more oomph. So much of oomph in that movie that I almost oomphed my way out of the hall! They were traces in the movie that reminded me of Pulp Fiction or even Sex and the City, which are both amazing productions in their own right and if only he had copied them we would have got everything we wanted. But no sir, we are too much into the East meets West syndrome these days. East meets West and takes a dive into the Pacific Ocean never to show itself again. Atleast not in the form of Boom! If this is what fusion of cultures is about I am all for pure breeds. I cannot imagine that I paid money to see a movie like this. I won't see it even if someone offered me money for this. The movie is like an orchestra in action and everything is being played out of tune and what is worse is that you can recognise what they are trying to play and that is driving you even more crazy.As for the crowd, what can I say, it deserved the movie as much as the movie deserved the crowd. Every show of skin and every raunchy dialogue were greeted with such cheers that you would assume that these women had landed in their laps! All this while cellphones were buzzing in the hall and everybody was talking to everybody else telling them they were sitting in a hall watching a movie- and what's up?Please go and see this movie and maybe it will help you appreciate how bad movie making can get. Its always nice to see the worst so we can better appreciate the good.As for the director and producer - BOOM BOOM!!","imdb_rating":1,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" Great concept poorly executed","review":"Boom was a great concept with a great soundtrack. The publicity was great and of course what a great title. The title track with Ila Arun/Talvin Singh saved some of the film.It seemed that most of the film was shot in daylight, which already compromises the dramatic quality of the film. The director used master shots with wide lenses, which again compromises drama and character build up. It seemed that the script was so loose that nothing seemed to stick. There were no character arcs and the movie came to an abrupt end. Even if violence and flesh are the idea, there are ways to make it tantalizing and provide for tension. Moreover Kaizad's characters were not believable because he spent little time on each with very limited staging. If a character spends all his time in one room, or doing just one thing, we cannot be too interested in him. What we call 'Emotional Dynamics'.The motivation was missing, why were the Dons after the models, when they didnt have the Diamonds? The limited locations and bright sunlight really dampened the quality of the film. The only dramatic light was with the Shroff character. The film had tremendous potential and a great concept in the making but I guess they were in hurry to get the film made.I think Kaizad is a passionate filmmaker who has the guts to break new ground, but in doing that, it is not wise to try and break all the basic rules of story telling.","imdb_rating":0,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" Ground breaking movie by bollywood standards","review":"I had earlier seen Bombay boys by Kaizad Gustad, hence this prompted me to rent out the video for Boom. The name itself is pretty unusual for a bollywood movie and the cast is the best that bollywood has to offer. Jackie as \"Medium\" again shows Jackie's potential as a versatile actor and Javed Jaffery as \"Boom Shankar\" is his usual eccentric self. No wonder Kaizad decided to name the movie over his character, Javed Jaffery lends the comical edge to the otherwise dark-sided movie. 3 gangsters bade, chote and medium rule the fashion industry helped by boom shankar. In a world where everyone is being terrorised by the 3 brothers 3 models are forced to work for them. Taking advantage of their beauty and charms, supplemented by their utter distrust of each other and aided by Boom shanker - these 3 models fool everyone including Boom shankar himself. Madhu Sapre along with the Kaif lend the bitchish touch the models character, showing why beauty is skindeep. As expected this movie was treated like a shocker by the indian cinema houses, because by any bollywood standard this movie is ground breaking. For the simple reason that it does not follow the nuances of a commercial bollywood film and follows on Quinton Tarantino's path i vote this movie as a must see for every hindi film critic.","imdb_rating":0,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" Only Boom Boom Bang Bang","review":"You want to make a dark comedy and mix it with big spoonfuls of sex and violence. And one reason that inspires you to do it is that for Hindi cinema it would be ground-breaking. And then when you pitch your script to cast the roles, you put together an ensemble that looks fantastic on paper. And then you have the distributors knocking on your doors because the package looks so damn good. And your reputation as a filmmaker who demolishes conventional boundaries coupled with an awesome marketing campaign makes the film a delicious event to look forward to. But alas, you disappoint immensely. Not because you or the film lacks intelligence. Not because the actors don't live up to their reputation. Not because the music and photography don't add amazing tension and interest to the film. And also not because the dark elements, the funny moments or the sexual angles are missing. But because Mr. Gustad you have failed as a writer in the film. You have been unable to give the film just that minimal structure, so you could have balanced the dark and comedic elements of the film. Your pen has failed in translating your vision perhaps even on paper, but definitely on film. Maybe you realised this sitting at the editing table with your editor, because the film does seem very choppy at times. Or maybe you thought that shortening the length would distract us from the flaws. But your energy and originality are visible in every frame. Hopefully, in future you will be able to collaborate with screenplay writers just as well as you have collaborated with the actors here - who have all done well in spite of wafer-thin characters. Maybe it was intentional; to an extent it does work - but could have worked better. Style and substance should go hand in hand and not invade each other's space. You are a young budding genius whose future films I will be looking forward to. Hopefully, film financiers and producers will continue to encourage and recognize your future. In the meanwhile, Boom explodes like a grenade whose pin came off suddenly. 5/10.","imdb_rating":5,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" So little with so much","review":"Gustad is a lucky director in that he got to do a big film after the mediocre Bombay Boys. For Boom he got the likes of Bachan, Shroff, Zeenat Amaan et al and had the deep pockets to shoot at Burj Al Arab and pretty much wherever he wanted in India and Dubai. He also had the names of Bo Derek and Padma Lakshmi (Salman Rushdie's model girlfriend) to play up in the marketing campaign... and what did he do with all this! He sank it all.He has three cuties in the cast who are raring to bare it all, and did quite often; he got tremendous performances from the lower league actors, Gulshan Grover and specially Javed Jaffrey; there's the ever sellable cocktail of sex, drugs and money; and despite everything there ARE quite a few laughs in the film. So what went wrong?The story. Or rather the lack of it. It seems Gustad was shooting on random notes rather than a script. The result is a series of shots - some beautiful, sexy and very funny, others irrelevant or incomprehensible, or both - put together in a jumpy fashion, and served up with a lot of glitter to make it look like a feature film. Sound levels are particularly bad, and some of the dialogue is lost either in strange accents the actors are putting on, or in the sound quality. Seems like the flick was only intended to be watched, not heard.I watched the movie against many an advice, but I'd like to recommend it to all those who are interested in movies.

The models in the movie just proved models can't act...lolSome of the vulgarity in the movie wasn't necessary at all, Zeenat aman has chosen the role which I wouldn't look at it twice if I was ever offered it, even junior artists would think twice...if I ever had to re make this movie it will be a life time block buster just by learning the mistakes from the whole movie itself script writer/ dialogues cameraman and the rubbish director...Ayesha Shroff if you ever go into production again make sure huni you do your homework, cause the movie Boom was not worth releasing or risking your house and life over...I'm surprised Jackie Shroff as superstar went ahead with releasing the movie when he clearly knew the Indian audience...so therefore Ayesha Shroff you are not just bolay like Jackie calls you, cause Jackie is dumb and your dumber...but Tiger Shroff your son rocks he will definitely replace the khan's few years to come, but please Ayesha don't make another disastrous movie with Tiger by risking your house again that will cost Tigers career the way it did to Jackie's Career...Back to the movie, when Jackie was pointing the fingers on the models boobs was disgusting it was disrespectable to women...you could had done that scene in a different and dignified way...Amitabh Bacchan looked complete pathetic...Javed Jaffery and seema Biswas came out shining the rest star cast appeared confused...I decided to watch this movie when I watched koffee with Karan, Jackie Shroff's Mrs Ayesha was talking about the movie Boom...bless her she was ever so emotional about the whole process of the movie before and after...If the movie ever had to be re made, they would need a better script, Dialogues,DIRECTION and decent realistic character names and actors who can act for sure... then the movie will rock...","imdb_rating":1,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" I think Bollywood audiences are not ready for a movie like this.","review":"I think Boom is a very weird film for Bollywood.'cause the Bollywood audience is not ready for a film like this.It contains too much vulgarity. If it had nudity the movie might be accepted 'cause it does have some pretty faces.But even the pretty faces,excellent performer like Amitabh, Jackie, Gulshan & Javaid, and great visuals could not save this Diamond bubble of a movie,which just burst with a BOOM.(Pun Intended).The ending although had a nice twist but was very stupid.An actor like Amitabh shouldn't have signed a movie like this.Jackie looked like he had been watching The Untouchables & Scarface while shooting for this movie.Zeenat Aman had no role to talk of.Bo Derak Was a joke.She was there for even less then 30 seconds.The models acting was like wooden,Xcept Madhu Sapre,who was just passable.So who should see movie ?.Well definitely not the family audiences.Only Die Hard fans of the cast members should see this movie, and even they would feel cheated as the big names have the smaller roles.","imdb_rating":0,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" Wonderful blend of visual, cultural, aural, sexual, nonsensical.","review":"A movie that everyone interested in bollywood, or film in general, should see.  Wonderful visuals. Interesting snippits of bollywood culture - is Boom really the typical Bombay/Mumbai man? Ai, Ai, Ai, typical or not he is fun to watch and listen too.  The easy blend of English and Hindi puts \"spanglish\" to shame. Click those subtitles \"ON\" when you watch! The sexual innuendo from \"Later\" to \"give her a kiss\" are pretty innocent and mild by Western standards, and thus so fresh and refeshing to a porn-raised western audience. The dance scene could have been the inspiration for the hallucination scene in the Big Lebowski (except that Lebowski is from 1998, five years before the 2003 Boom). To top it off, the plot shows women as intelligent, self-assured, and in charge - even women thought of by others as dumb eye candy only. It also shows the impoverished worker as capable and smart, while the weathly gangsters are the stupid ones. This is a Democratic movie and sticks it to the rich Republican gangsters of this world.  Of course, the unneccessary on-screen violence, drug use, and death ruins those parts of the film, but that's why we have eyes -- just close them for a moment here and there, and enjoy the rest of this treasure of a film.","imdb_rating":10,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" Quite groundbreaking by Bollywood standards","review":"I just saw this movie last night and really enjoyed it.  While I was with some people who disliked it, I felt that the film was provocative and a really gutsy move at being anti-Bollywood.  I'm not Indian and I saw the film in NYC without subtitles (it was a mix of Hindi and English).  While the film wasn't perfect (and the last third of the movie really sank it downhill), there were some unique moments (the song-and-dance number, a lot of the wide-lens cinematography, Big B and Jackie Shroff's disturbing and brazen performances).  And I really felt that I didn't know what was going to happen next from scene to scene.  Heck, during much of it, I felt like this guy was reinventing the crime genre black comedy much like Quentin Tarantino did with \"Reservoir Dogs.\"  I do wish that the director was a little more disciplined but I guess if he was, he wouldn't be crazy enough to launch what seems like drug-addled, adrenaline-fueled imagery.  A definite must-see in my book and one that even a Western audience may appreciate in spots.","imdb_rating":9,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" style over substance","review":"OK kaizaad gustaad is suffering from a major Tarantino/wachkowski bros ( from their bound days)hangover..while this movie is groundbreaking by bollywood standards, one cannot but help feel a major sense of deja vue while watching it..seems to be an overstylsed mish mash of QT movies ( which are themselves an homage to hong kong movies)the story is non existent,, the characters r not fleshed out and why is it that EVERY mob character HAS to have a quirk/idiosyncrasy? Despite that, the dialogs are clever and javed jaffrey excels..I hope in his future films, kaizaad also pays a lil attention to the substance! he's got the style thing down pat!","imdb_rating":4,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" OH MY GOD","review":"I'm still in a state of shock, i think i may have officially seen the worst movie ever made, and believe me I have seen a lot of rubbish movies but I think I can safely say this is a number 1. I watched it cos a friend said it was really funny and laughable script.. but I definitely wasn't prepared for this. Though seriously how many types of class drugs could the 'director' possible have been on.. watever he's smoking I want. Plus is he trying to be tarantino wats with all the 'reservoir dogs' connections. I dunno much about indian movies but I thought amhitab is one of the respected type actors.. how did he get involved with this. As for the plot all I could get ,between the sudden cuts in the movie (probably happened later in the editing room once the weed ran out), is that there are 3 'baddies' whose names read like a fast food menu, Big Medium and Small and there are 3 model types,whose names I can't remember but I'd rather call Miss my knees never meet, Miss whiny I dont do anything memorable, and Miss no one remembers my face... and thru some this plot line these 6 ppl meet. Weird thing is burj al Arab allowed them to rent the hotel for this long.. bet the owner was on holiday or somethingId give it a 1 cos it really does make u laugh watch out for the sing and dance number at the bank robbery","imdb_rating":1,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" kyoon bhai... itni trajedy. :(","review":"Had the displeasure of seeing Boom on a 150 bucks ticket yesterday. I rue my decision of watching a Hindi flick on a theatre after such a long time. Hindi Movie? Yup, for no understandable logic, even the PVR Priya ran the Hindi version of the Movie. OMFG this was a sad sad day. The movie was not a movie after all. More like a fashion show with some weirdo background thrown in. Whole of the movie was concentrated on the three idiot models. Loads of footage was given to the bulging bosoms and tiny pieces of garments they accidentally were wearing. This when the movie cast consisted of 4 of the most talented actors of this generation. Amitabh Bachchan, Javed Jaffrey, Gulshan Grover and Jackie Shroff - These 4 guys are awesome in themselves but all are wasted. Making the models, the center point of the movie was a mistake. But this stands true only if Kaizad Gustad in fact was trying to make a movie. The saving grace was definitely Zeenat Amaan who still is capable of kicking any of the featured model's ass. Among the cameos, I liked Rohit Bal best. He proved that the models can learn something about acting from him.Irony of the movie: When Jackie Shroff compared the models to his ahem ahem employee Pavitra. That was awesome. Some food for thought!\nIn one sentence: If you are looking for a movie with some logic, skip it. But perhaps no one wants/expects it to be a movie after all. not even the director, I suppose.Someone tell me this. IMDB list Manish Malhotra, Naseeruddin Shah and various other celebrities in the star cast as special appearances. I can't remember catching these. Perhaps they came when I slept tired of kicking my own ass...IMDB's User Comments: THE WORST MOVIE EVER I don't agree. Aks was worse.","imdb_rating":1,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0}],"imdbId":"tt0330082"}
