It stars Fardeen Khan in one of his Best films. It marks the debut of the very cute Richa Pollad. Richa is quite a talented actress, surprisingly she is not doing much movies. This movie is set in the village / countrylife. If you have experienced living in the village life, then you may know how fun it can be. This is what this film is all about. Fardeen and his family re unite with other members of their family after a large feud. It has a striking similarity with The Masterpiece Kabhie Khushi Kabhie Gham. Where instead of Hritik trying to re unite, we have Fardeen trying to re unite. It has the Dilwale Dulhania le jayenge feeling toward the end. It is best if you go and watch this movie. I'm surprised that it didn't do too well at the box office. The movie has Nice songs. If you haven't seen this movie yet, i suggest you see it. If you like your family movies, then you will like this.","imdb_rating":10,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" Family drama","review":"Have seen many family drama movies, it TOP of my favorite (family). Do watch it whenever i try to give my mind some rest.It clears all my stress and to all reminds me of my first love. It all going personal , i know but the fact is most of you family drama lovers would feel the same after watching. Movies should be such that it can touch your heart bringing over reality life around you or should be good enough to compete with world class films. Its a efficient film, no instance of it would disappoint you , i promise. Desi style love, just love it.And of the actress's voice, its so relaxing , sweet,touching ,soothing whateverSo its a movie worth watching .","imdb_rating":8,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0}],"imdbId":"tt0327004"}
