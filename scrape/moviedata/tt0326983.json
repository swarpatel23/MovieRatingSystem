Absolutely AMAZING...hahaha (I'm still laughing)","review":"This movie deserves the 10 I'm giving it.But it's not the 10 that you'd give to movies like 'The Godfather' or 'Goodfellas' or 'Psycho'. This is the kind of 10 you give to a movie which just makes you laugh,over and over again! It's the most horribly written and directed movie, yet it doesn't fail to entertain. It has the most amateur effects, yet you enjoy every moment! I saw this movie today on TV, and I didn't want to move away! Read the following dialogue to know why!(Whole college is standing around Manisha,who has just undergone a rape attempt and the guys who attempted the rape are asking for forgiveness)Bad Guy 1: Please forgive us! Bad guy 2: Yes,we won't do it again. (No response from Manisha) Akshay: Come on,forgive them! Manisha: I don't know... Akshay: You are a beautiful woman, and even dead men can get aroused by you! And these are living young males! Don't blame them!Pancholi: Yeah Manisha.. Manisha(To Suniel): What if they tried to rape your girlfriend??? Suniel: I'd break their hands,legs and kill them.But anyways,just forgive them..Akshay: Yeah if you don't forgive them then it will be as though you are too arrogant about your beauty!Now that is a true masterpiece of a dialogue! This movie never fails to entertain, mainly because there are so many goofs and unrealistic situations! The bad guy (Munish) can do basically anything..He can blow a sandstorm from his mouth, or he can get a motorcycle from his backside and just as easily make it disappear again. Every actor takes turns to speak..One line from Akshay,then from Suniel, then from Arshad, then Aftab, then Nigam. It's the main rule followed by the director, so that equal screen time is given to each guy. And then there's the all powerful pendant, which can cause even a speeding car to go right through you without you being harmed! All these things make it an enjoyable movie, and I can watch it over and over again. I think this movie can go into the comedy hall of fame if there is one..The only problem is that it wasn't trying to be funny.","imdb_rating":10,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" One of its kind!","review":"This movie beats everything out there. Well, depends on what you are looking for... it could be a 10 or a 1 on the scale. This movie is in a complete league of its own.. I don't think any movie could possibly come close to it. I am not sure what the director intended to make it as.. a thriller or a comedy. If he did think he was making a thriller, then he has by a stroke of luck, created one of the best bollywood comedies of all time. You have to see it to believe it.. a matrix + terminator + a host of other movies rolled into one, along with a storyline dating back to 1980's Hindi movies, with a icchadhari naag (a mythical snake which can turn into a human).Its an ideal movie if you are sitting with a bunch of friends with alcohol on the side, planning to laugh at the movie! I am not sure whether to give it a 1 or a 10.. On the basis of flipping a coin, I have decided to give it a 1!","imdb_rating":1,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" wow....","review":"OK, I would give this a 1, but I'm gonna give it a two because I laughed while watching this film...First of all, I can make a much better movie than this one...in a week...The special effects made this film look like a joke. One shouldn't make such films with horrible special effects because then people won't take it seriously. The acting and direction was also horrible. The screenplay had many plot holes and the whole film wasn't believable at all. This has to be the worst Indian film ever. The songs were also bad. The acting was bad and artificial. Need I say more. Don't watch this movie unless you are curious to see how bad it is. That's why I watched it. I am going into film and I wanted to see how bad a bad film can get. Trust me, I watched one of the worst films in history if not THE worst film.","imdb_rating":2,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" Wow ! They really tried hard to make the Worst movie in the Universe ...","review":"It seems that with this movie they wanted to get a Nobel Prize for being the pioneers of Worst Movie Making. A legendary low for Bollywood. I cannot believe they released this junk. It may sound paranoid but it seems this movie was deliberately thrust upon the masses to get some sort of psychological reaction and/or publicity. I cannot realise a script worse than this! Thumbs up to the director for this accomplishment. Anything worse than this cannot have even come in the domains of intelligible or comprehensible visual entertainment.Originality has been completely compromised with all exhibition and clear intentions. Climax idea taken from Terminator 2 - Judgement Day etc. I have no further civilised words to continue my review ...","imdb_rating":1,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" The Worst Indian Movie Ever!!","review":"This movie made me laugh so much. It was a bloody joke to tell you the truth. So unbelievable and the worst plot ever. The acting as well was bad. I don't how come so many popular Bollywood actors and actresses took on to do this movie. The script must have been somewhat of a joke. The visual effects in this movie was excrutiatingly painful to watch. I believe that a kindergarten kid could have done a better job of the visual effect and a monkey could have done a better job of coming up with a plot.The plot has numerous attempts at copying major Hollywood movies like The Terminator but it fails miserably. I laughed my head off seeing this movie. A total disaster in Indian cinema history!","imdb_rating":1,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" A Disgrace to Bollywood","review":"If you have seen this movie, then you will know that it is one of the worst Bollywood movies ever made. Bollywood is known to copy Hollywood movies. Who would of known that they will copy Terminator 2. The difference between both Film industries are Hollywood spends millions and Bollywood spends 100 thousands (Average). Thats the problem with this film, if you want to make a T2 style movie, then do it properly. The director added a bogus fantasy storyline about a reincarnated snake who finds his long lost girl (in the previous birth) dead by 2 guys, but the blame goes to 10 people. She suddenly reincarnates into a ghost and together they want to kill the 10 people they blame for her death. Not to mention, the Reincarnated snake guy or villain has some kind of super powers. He can transform into anything, he can fly, disappear, fire power, wind power, you name it, he has it. He even gets bazookered and survives the T1000 style. You are probably wondering how he survives. its best not to ask, and its best not to waste time and money on this movie. Its Best just to forget this film even came out. I think its a shame to use a big starcast for this outrageous movie with a nonsense storyline.","imdb_rating":1,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" This is a mish-mash of assorted Hindi and English movies - poorly done","review":"An insane assault on viewers senses.  This is a mish-mash of assorted Hindi and English movies - poorly done.  The name carries over from a 70s' multi star cast, which the 2002 version also boasts of.  The story is taken from the 70s' Sunil Dutt/Reena Roy starrer - \"Nagin\" and visual effects taken (a horrible attempt) from The Matrix, Terminator 2 and Mission Impossible II.Set in a college environment (Sunil Shetty, Akshaye Kumar, Manisha - college kids!!!???!!), Manisha Koirala is the victim, who mistakes a fatal assault on her by two students as a collective effort on the part of our heros.  As it turns out Manisha is a Cobra (Nag) snake reborn as a girl in this life and her mate from the previous life, now a super powerful-all-and-any-shape-assuming (Ichadhari Nag) - Munish Kohli, is out looking for her in this life. Manisha appeals to him to avenge her violation and murder.So begins the mad killing spree, where the avenging lover starts singling each male of the group, with increasing powers and tricks with successive attempts.  The effects are extremely cheap, with computer generated skeletons, morphing bodies and motorcycle stunts completing the farce.Carry over from Nagin includes Raj Babbar playing a catholic priest who provides temporary relief to our boys with a more \"Religiously correct\" multi-religion locket (the original Nagin only had an \"Om\") .  Sunny Deol plays Manisha's love interest in her current life and the ultimate saviour against the all powerful Munish Kohli.Music and songs are below average.Avoid if you don't fancy cheap thrills.","imdb_rating":1,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" What The FCUK!","review":"Before saying anything about this flick, let's enjoy a strange story.'Here comes an omnipotent serpent riding on a duplicate Harley Davidson. Wait a minute! Serpent on a bike? Yeah, that's true. The bike appears and disappears below his A$$ and the serpent, clad in a black cloak puts on his latest designer sunglasses.' Well if you aren't an Indian, you won't probably buy this trash, because when I say 'omnipotent' it means the serpent has almost all the magical abilities that allow him to transform into any being, avenge his honor with might, kill his enemies, and rule the world. The problem is, we are too grown up for this folklore.Rajkumar Kohli has always been obsessed with plots involving 'n' number of actors. By putting several stars on the screen, he seems to toil on making the 'one dialog per actor' rule in almost every scene, but entirely forgets the message a film is supposed to give. Whatever may have been the message of this film is out of question, but even if we assume that there was any, then it too passes out somewhere in the multitude of stars.I found this film laughable in every sense. The dialog is terrible and at times the acting is almost laughable. Akshay, Sunil, Manisha, Aftab, Aditya, Sunny etc. have all been in decent movies, but in this they look like they've just come out of rehabilitation center and took their parts for a quick buck. They clearly didn't read the script or say 'What The F!' before accepting their parts, which makes me think they didn't care as long as they got the work.No story, No plot, No believable characters, No good dialogs, No scares, No decent effects, No hummable songs, and No pretty girls (at least get some GOOD looking women, not the rehab retards).Not worth watching/renting. The movie sucks big time!","imdb_rating":0,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" No summary","review":"hi, This is the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. The day when I watched this movie, I was having high fever. But still I watched the movie with lots of patience. And after watching the movie, I felt like repenting. Because, I wasted 3 hrs for this stupid movie. I could have taken rest rather then watching this movie. And I was really surprised that how come actors like Sunny Deol, Akshay Kumar Aftab etc acted in this movie.I don't understand if directors don't find a good story to make a film then why do they remain as directors? Why can't they sit at home and spent their time at home? I request to all directors that it will be good for them if they request audiences, either by mail or by media, newspapers, radios etc... to send them a nice story if they don't find any good story for to make a film . I request again to all directors please don't make such films.","imdb_rating":1,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" Utter Disappointment!","review":"I am ashamed to admit in public that I even held the cover of this movie once! This is an absolute reason why one should research on the movie before seeing it! The 'makers' of this movie have called us all fools and gullible losers with too much time on our hands.Based on the mythical Indian shape-shifting powerful cobras and rebirth, the story takes us for a painful ride. College going 40+ actors (now really?) are the target of their former friend Manisha Koirala (who was in her former life a cobra, but is now a ghost!) and her pathetic, eternal, powerful boyfriend cobra/killing machine boyfriend Munish Kohli (who thankfully hasn't been seen since). Now do you need to know more?I vote for studying for the upcoming test in school rather than this movie! Give it a pass if you are sane. If not... then you'll probably enjoy it.","imdb_rating":1,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" Save your time & money. Stay away...","review":"Mish mash of all Hindi and Hollywood action & emotion packed dramas. A complete waste of 3 hours of your precious time! The whole story flows in fits and starts. The only acting that was happening was that all the actors were making weird faces at the camera and screaming most of the time. Due to the number of stars, maybe all the stars were allotted some screen time randomly and the movie was assembled and shown to the public. The SFX were cheap and jarring. Acting was of the poorest quality. Songs were painful, though one was supposedly comical (Javed Bhai So Rele Hai).All this just to re-launch a star son devoid of any acting talent. It just wasn't a horror movie, it was horrible.Watch it if you want to see the worst Hindi movie ever made. If not, then steer clear...","imdb_rating":0,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" Get a life low voters","review":"All the people who voted a meager 1 on this movie, this is all I have to say: You guys have not matured enough to enjoy cinema of this kind. It takes a certain amount of dedication to reach that level of appreciation. And that is the segment of people this movie was aimed at. Not you average movie-goers by any chance! . Back to the movie. This one was a gem all right and definitely an inclusion in the Bollywood hall of fame. I'd give it an all time rank of no # 2, surpassed only by Kanti Shah's legendary Gunda. This movie had an impeccable story line and created a beautiful blend between a fantasy and sci-fi. Pan's Labyrinth would have in fact been ashamed of the balance created between the parallel stories. And now do i really need to mention the stellar cast and even stellar-er (that is a word from NOW) performances from them (a special mention goes to Mr. Nigam for the best debut ever in any movie on this earth). Every actor in this movie had been very carefully chosen and the role were tailor made for them (and for their age too, I must add). Manisha Koirala still looks like she's 18 and wow man, with that figure I would have raped her too. Are you wondering where did this rape thing come in suddenly? Yes, a rape is what the premises of this movie is based on. And that is so not like your average Bollywood type movies. If you are an atheist or an agnostic by any chance, this movie is again a must for you. Because this movie can heal your faith. I don't think it'd even be going too far saying that this movie can cure cancer. Only the people who need it the most fail to appreciate its power, charm and undying beauty. Tchch, so unfortunate!Only flaw in this movie: In your dreams, baby! This was flawless.Only minor complain: The director failed to star Mithun Da as well. I won't ruin it for you any further. Just go and watch it. TODAY. And if you like it, here are some more recommendation from me. Gunda, Desh Drohi, Aparichit, the old Ramsay Brothers horror movies, Loha, Indra the tiger and Sivaji.","imdb_rating":10,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" It is not a movie. It is a star kids 1000th launchpad","review":"Rajkumar Kohli made famous movies during 1970's . His movies like Naagin (1976) and ironically same title Jaani Dushman (1979) were extremely successful since they were multistarrers with Horror as the theme.He clubbed the two scripts and made this film as his son's Launchpad in 2002. His son had delivered plenty of flop films before this movie and had ensured to the audience that he is a terrible actor.He was cast as the Antagonist in this film and the starcast including fantastic actors like Sunny Deol, Akshay Kumar, Arshad Warsi , Suniel Shetty and many more had to fight Armaan Kohli who was a combination of Naagin + Terminator and Matrix Reloaded.The film proves the point that in the Hindi film industry these kids of Producers land with meaty roles and spoil a movie experience.If they want to spend their fathers money. They would rather go on exotic holidays and save us from the horror of watching their acting on screen. A disappointing film that turns out to be unintentionally funny.

So you have to take into account the time consumed and thus it is obvious that all students are 40+ Also the school admits students of a 'heavier' dispensation and has a course of P.Hd in weight loss and the only student who failed this course is Manisha Koirala. Only she was a snake in the past life. Still not convinced? OK read on.Here's a scene. Akshay Kumar, a college student, is chased by Arman and he takes out a bazooka and shoots him! Then throws grenades. Then one of the grenades hits Akshay. But doesn't die and continues to fight, Arman, the snake, plunges a half foot dagger into Akshay and stomps on it but Akshay is still there. Then Akshay gets on a jet ski and follows Arman. They fight and Arman chokes Akshay underwater and finally Akshay is dead. So we think, as soon as Arman is out of the picture Akshay swims away to Raj Babbar, Principal of this college + Boxing Refree + Parapsychology ka professor + mumbling priest.But no one, I repeat no one takes the cake but a certain Mr. Nigam.

The stellar star cast is only an added bonus over the amazing special effects, and profound story and sublime choreography. The movie is about an ancient love affair that folds down into the modern world. Two lovers in heaven incur the wrath of a great sage and are cursed. Subsequently the woman is born again on earth. While she is in college, she is raped and commits suicide. The rest of the movie basically focuses on the hunting down of the people who were associated with the rape, by her lover who possesses superhuman strength and the mastery of several languages. Sonu Nigam delivers a very mature and deep performance in this film, and all the other actors do almost as well. Te action scenes with Akshay Kumar are mind-blowing, and must not be missed.

I don't understand why so many stars of that time appeared in such a film.","imdb_rating":1,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" Worst film of last decade","review":"The film was in news due to it's huge cast, from Akshay,Sunil,Aftab(all three starred in Awara Paagal Deewana in the same year), Aditya Panscholi, Sharad Kapoor, Sonu Nigam(acting debut), Arshad Warsi(in his bad days). etc plus special appearances by Sunny Deol,Atul Agnihotri and many actresses from Manisha Koirala, Rambha who were going through almost extinct phase and many unknown actresses. The film actually was made to relaunch Munish(Arman Kohli) Kohli by his father Rajkumar Kohli yet again after previous failed attempts like Virodhi, Qahar, Aulad Ke Dushman.etc Rajkumar Kohli thought casting his son with bigger stars right from his first film will take him places, but anywayz nothing happened The film makes even badly made comedies seem masterpeices. First of all, 40 yr old actors play college students, at least ppl can forgive Srk or Aamir but Aditya Panscholi, Sharad Kapoor, Akshay Kumar.etc as students? The scenes are directed like a stage play where each actor gets one dialogue to say The film mixes NAGIN and JAANI DUSHMAN(old) and we have special effects from THE MUMMY to every Hollywood film ever seen. Scenes seem cut and pasted, no logic, no sense.etc Just witness the scene when all stars try to convince Manisha to forgive Rajat Bedi for attempting to molest Manisha. In fact every scene is like a badly made 70s movie.Direction by Rajkumar Kohli is pathetic Music is nothing greatAmongst the huge cast, all have hardly anything worthwhile Akshay Kumar gets some scope but he is decent, his death scene seems weird as he never dies. Suneil Shetty is horrible, though its not his blame entirely Aftab is as usual, Arshad Warsi just cracks jokes, poor guy he was in his bad phase, Aditya Panscholi, Sharad Kapoor are all okay Sunny Deol has a brief role and is as usual, Sonu Nigam can give Fardeen Khan in Prem Aggan a run for his money in the worst debut award, he is simply nonsense. Armaan Kohli who was relaunched is given to glare, growl this actor has a good voice and a height but lacks everything else Manisha Koirala(poor thin) looks plump and is okay, post 2000 her career went downhill Rambha too slowly started fading away The rest heroines just are there one heroine who is paired opposite Suneil, stands out due to her bad dubbing, her voice keeps echoing.One weird thing to speak about in the film is the poor set design, in the scene when Manisha hears Arman's voice, the buildings in the background look like cardboard.","imdb_rating":1,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" This movie can be crap/entertaining depending on the way you see it","review":"I just want to start off the review by saying that Rajkumar Kohli is a multi star specialist as he made NAGIN (76), JAANI DUSHMAN (79), RAAJ TILAK (84) so a whole host of Bollywood actors coming to work in what IMDb users call \"the worst film ever\" is not surprise. But the fact that the directors son Armaan Kohli is in the movie takes us back to the 90s where Rajkumar repeatedly tried to launch his son but his sons career never rose. The crazier thing was that Rajkumar had cast him opposite famous stars to get him noticed but sadly nothing worked. A revamped version of the formula is evoked in Rajkumar Kohli's recent offering JAANI DUSHMAN: EK ANOKHI KAHANIThe film is a modern day version of NAGIN (no f****** idea where the original JAANI DUSHMAN came in except the place where Manisha gets raped) with Armaan's character being Terminator 2 and an Ichadari Nag which already sounds coolManisha is raped by two dudes and stabs herself then blames her friends (Rajat Bedi mimics everyone's voice on the phone). Enter Armaan who he and her were lovers centuries ago but an angry sage banished Manisha and said to Armaan he could reunite with her in the 21st century. Now he has but she dead. Now her ghost and Armaan will take revenge. But how? Well Manisha is a ghost and can go inside people and control them and do stuff while Armaan has developed super powers while waiting for Manisha like blowing sandstorms out of his mouth, turning into a bike, making knives out of his hands and do matrix stuffThe reason Manisha blames her friends is just unintentionally hilarious and would have worked in a comedy movieBecause IMDb users have ridiculed this movie so much I might as well reveal what happensWho dies?? Rajat Bedi- Manisha turns into a skeleton (people said it was a ripoff of the mummy) ane throws him off a 20 storey building Sharad Kapoor-Armaan turns into a bike and drives onto his neck Arshad Warsi- thrown into a pool and electrocuted Aditya pancholi- Manisha's ghost goes into Aftab and makes Aftab kill Aditya Aftab Shidvasabi- Manisha ghost possessed him and made him kill Aditya but law and order wont believe this so they order him to get hanged Sunil Shetty- Manisha goes inside him and throws him off a buildingAkshay Kumar- now his death was the most annoying and sad as he delivers the best performance. Its true that Akshay is very likable in the movies that he dies in. Akshay fought with Armaan and due to a huge explosion went into a coma. When Sonu is last man standing Akshay wakes up and gets stabbed by Armaan then Armaan stomps on the knife. Then Akshay gets on a jetski to save Sonu and then choked by armaan underwater. But wait Akshay faked it and is still alive but oh no. He staggers to Raj Babbar and in a very sad and emotional scene, he dies. He should not have died and this was a complete misfire. He was the main dude and it would have made an awesome ending if he survived as well. I have not mentioned Sunny Deol yet. Of course he is shown on the movie posters but he is just a guest appearance. He is supposed to be married to Manisha but he goes to London and Armaan comes in. Ugh. Sunny has an fight scene, goes London, phoned by his stepbrother Sonu to come and in a matter of minutes Sunny travels from London to Mumbai and in the climax saves his bro and kills Armaan. Music: Chal Kudiye and Roop Salona Tere are the type of songs that uou feel you have heard of before and are enjoyable. The Jaaneman Tu Khub Hai song is OK and has too many costume changes. The Javed Bhai So Rele Hai song is just plain stupid.Armaan Kohli is considered one of the worst actors of Bollywood. So him being the villain makes the audience hate him even more and that's why him being the villain works in this movie. The heroines are ordinary and are just opportunities for Armaan and Manisha to kill the goodies.In spite of the many flaws this movie can be quite enjoyable and definitely is a pulse pounding ride.","imdb_rating":4,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" So bad that it so good !!","review":"How does one start describing an awful movie like 'Jaani Dushman'??I was in school when this movie was released and was panned by everyone. The film was so bad that many of us from school went to watch it because to enjoy it for its sheer stupidity.This film boasts of some talented actors like Akshay Kumar, Arshad Warsi, Aftab Shivdasani, Sunny Deol and above all Manisha Koirala. Now, why they signed this movie would be a question that will remain unanswered till eternity !! Also, why Sonu Nigam wanted to start his acting career through this crap will also remain unanswered. One thing is for sure, if given a chance, all the above mentioned actors would do their best to remove this movie from their resumes and audiences memory.Taking two olden Indian beliefs of rebirth and nagins (cobras), this cocktail is awful from the word go. Logic is just thrown out of the window. The sets are horrible and the visual effects would leave anyone in splits. E.g. Some of the scenes are ripped off from 'The Matrix' that left me bewildered and laughing.Everyone hams in this movie and the music is equally bad. Worse, Manisha Koirala is overweight in this film for some reason and for some odd logic, Deol is able to kill the main protagonist in the end.Now coming to the main protagonist i.e. Armaan Kohli. Armaan tries and tries hard but can't act at all and is a disaster. Hats off to his father to make a film like this for his son. Kohli Sr. would have never thought that his son would become some sort of national embarrassment and butt of jokes for years to come. Poor Armaan, your Dad just over did it for you. Today, he is one of the contestants in Big Boss Season 7 here in India. And people still remember him thanks to this film.

Some stupid scenes include Akshay Kumar pulling a gun out of nowhere to kill a hologram (yes a hologram), Akshay Kumar carrying a bazooka around the town, Rajat Bedi getting beaten up by a poorly animated skeleton, Rajat Bedi and Siddharth double penetrating Monisha Korella (How did they think this was straight?). Also i'd like to point out that the animations are absolutely terrible. The scene that supports this statement is when Kapal has the motorbike and somehow gains the glasses. The shopping job looks like it was done in microsoft paint.The best parts in this movie are with Sunny Deol. This man is so strong that he makes even god feel scared. In one scene, he literally breaks open a jail door by kicking it. Chuck Norris' round-house has nothing on that! He is even so powerful, that he can fly from London to India in a matter of 10 minutes! Overall, this movie is perhaps the most poorly made movie in the universe.
