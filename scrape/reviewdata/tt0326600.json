I am saying you simply that there is no villain in this movie but the hero of the movie is real villain he thrushes every guy in his way beat everyone who talks with him & I still hope that he enjoys it so well the leading lady has no work in this movie along the to play love game with hero . our hero is the relative of superman & batman & iron man also . I hope so you can understand that what type of amazing movie it is I have no complaint but one that why IMDb has no negative ratings","imdb_rating":1,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" No words to describe this mess","review":"When a superstar's brother makes a film to make himself a superstar by directing, editing, shooting, acting in short doing everything in the entire movie and that to say he's just plain bad, you can expect the horrendous results. I have been through this torture on satellite cable and just wonder how people must have survived this mess in the theater. It was a box office anyway","imdb_rating":1,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" Debut of Sohail Khan","review":"Sohail Khan started off as a director with Auzaar which was a flop, then later followed by his only success Pyaar Kiya To Darna Kya and then a dud Hello Brother(1999) In 2002 he launched himself in Maine Dil Tujhko Diyaa, Those days Salman was going through a bad phase himself. Sohail Khan repeats the same formula in first half of PKTDK, The focus is on college comedy and romance, Sohail Khan in his 30s and with his bulky frame despite his physique looks odd as a college student. But then even Sallu played a college student in PKTDK. So that Sohail can show his muscles he introduces drama(age-old), rivalry and action Near Interval he introduces Sanjay Dutt in the film who plays a gangster, who favours romance as his brother had committed suicide. What follows is typical vendetta fare. There are some good moments like the clash between Sohail and Sanju at times is good The climax is prolonged and there is overdose of blood spill.Direction by Sohail Khan is below average, he resorts to age old stuff to carry the story forward, though he does handle some scenes well Music by Daboo Malik is good, Thoda sa Pyaar is the best song, while Tana Tana is good tooSohail Khan looks bulky, has a terrible dialogue delivery but does act well in many scenes, Sameera Reddy is terrible in her debut, her voice irritates. Sanjay Dutt in a small role is good in his part. Amongst rest Kabir Bedi is adequate, Rajpal Yadav does well in a gangster role but does overdo it too often, Sarfaraz Khan is good Eiyaz Khan and others are okay.","imdb_rating":2,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" nice movie","review":"i liked the movie a lot its entertaining i like the romantic love story of this film good songs good music good direction good acting performances this is decent watch salmans brother so-hail did wonderful acting in his debut start the heroine did well sanjay was excellent in his role my rating 7/10","imdb_rating":7,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" Save for Sanju, this movie is sheer disappointment","review":"Its one of those typical stories with mainstream dialogues and action topped with lousy acting. Most the movie is difficult to watch. Even the action scenes are exaggerated and acting is dull. The only decent thing to come out of this movie is Sanjay dutt's mafia role. He has played his character incredibly well and is the reason I'm giving 5 stars","imdb_rating":7,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0}]
