[{"heading":" Life is Beautiful","review":"The lovely Tabu is Shalu in Zindagi Khoobsoorat Hai (Life Is Beautiful). Amar (Gurdas Mann), a wannabe film-star in Bombay meets Shalu, who is a prostitute whose liver suffers from too much liquor. There is also a mafia boss and his 8 year old daughter, Jameela, who is kind of autistic and only a music video of Amar seems to make her happy. The mafia boss kidnaps Amar to make his daughter happy and through all sorts of twists and turns Shalu and Amar and Jameela play a happy family for the sake of the little and the big girl. They fall in love and in the end the question is, will Amar make his dreams of being a film-star come true or will he save the two strangers that became his loved ones? Once that question is answered, there's still a twist to overcome...This is a nice fairytale, Bollywood at what it does best. Never mind whether this film had flopped or not (my guess is it has flopped.) One can criticize that the story is a bit far fetched and some of the characters in it enter the scene a bit confusingly unrelated. But the bittersweet feeling and the exciting mix of evil characters and the highest of human values that even overlap can keep one captivated. The music is nice, the cinematography presents us many beautiful pictures and the dialogs also have a special beauty to them. It does suggest that life is indeed beautiful.","imdb_rating":7,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0}]
