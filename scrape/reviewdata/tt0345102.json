[{"heading":" lukewarm remake of Bound","review":"the main attraction of Bound was that there was no male protagonist, only 2 female leads, & the fact that they have a steamy love scene together. this Hindi remake chickens out on the lesbian angle, and substitutes a male character as the friendly neighbor.having said that, it's not too bad. at least there are no songs. but the maximum level of sexuality in the film is a few kissing scenes, all involving Tara Deshpande.","imdb_rating":0,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" worth a watch -Beware Spoilers !","review":"this movie is very unconventional from regular  Hindi movies and there are no songs or heroines running round trees. Instead Unnati (played by Tara Deshpande) plays the ultimate femme fatalle who hatches a successful plan to usurp money from her husband with the help of her lover. The ending is also unconventional and made by jaw drop.","imdb_rating":0,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" Highly enjoyable","review":"This movie is quite good the tension in this film revolving around Ashutosh Rana's character is most delightful to watch his strange hilarious acting is good Tara Deshpande plays her cheesy role very well and the climax is truly wonderful such a treat can come out of watching this movie it's bizarre good no songs and well for a directorial debut Govind Menon really shows us he's one hell of a director the new actor also does a good job as a boyfriend and of course the main character newcomer it's pretty good movie with elements unique to Indian cinema can give the cinegoers really something to watch and say hey it's better than all the other cinema crap that you see hey let's try this movie out overall an enjoyable watch with experienced actors who can give the audience something to watch great job on Govind Menon's directorial debut","imdb_rating":9,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0}]
