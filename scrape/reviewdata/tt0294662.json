[{"heading":" When Hollywood makes a Bollywood film.","review":"Let me begin by saying that I write this review with a very open mind. I have deliberately refrained from comparing this film to a dozen Hollywood films I have seen in the past. I think its unfair to judge a Bollywood film produced entirely in Hollywood with a budget that's a fraction of the cost of a low budget Hollywood film. Let's judge this cinema as we judge an Indian cinema.  The opening sequence of this film sets the atmosphere for a warm summer day in LA. It sets the mood for some sinister event that is yet to happen. Some crime has taken place in the City and the usual suspects are rounded up by the LAPD and questioned. The usual suspects being: the Yashvardhan Rampal \"Major\" (Amitabh Bachan), Jay Rehan 'Ajju' (Sanjay Dutt), Marc Issak (Sunil Shetty), Raj Yadav (Mahesh Manjrekar), Anand Mathur (Kumar Gaurav), and Maqbool Haider (Lucky Ali). None of them trust each other, yet they team up to rob a bank. (By mentioning the words \"usual suspects\" please bear in mind that I am not throwing you any hints.)The first five minutes of the film sets the mood, perspective, character relationships, general theme of the story and direction of the plot. This first six minutes in itself is a first as far as Hindi film goes.\nOne of the most outstanding features of this film is that it has done away with post production voice dubbing, and has made live on site recording of the dialogues. This is a real change from the unnatural dubbed voice-overs we have grown sick and tired of in Bollywood films. Dialogues are natural and the sound actually blends in with the LA atmosphere. There is also depth and perspective to the sounds. The sounds of police siren wailing away till kingdom come, constantly reminds us that it is really LA. Some real professionals have been put to work on the sound recording.\nThe title sequence in this film is also a welcome change. Something I have never seen in other Hindi movies. Smartly designed urban typography with proper spacing and thematic colours. Music is well chosen. Timing is uniform. Motifs and theme are consistent. simply smashing !!!For once Americans speak the way Americans usually speak as opposed to the usual slowed-down-for-desi-audience-dialogues we usually hear in Indian films. Cinematography of Kaante is simply brilliant.  One can see a perfect marriage of editing and photography with sharp cuts, different camera angles and some dramatic perspectives of Los Angeles city. Anamorphic lenses have been cleverly used to show wide angle shots especially during the shots of the LA strip bar. However the use of warm filter has been a bit overdone. Some indoor night shots can be seen in warm tones, which was quite unnecessary. Some nice time lapse sequences and aerial shots can also be seen. This does not mean the photographer goes on a tour of LA city tour, as most Bollywood photographers do while shooting in foreign lands. You also won't see the hero and heroin doing the usual Universal Studios tour in this movie for a change.Kaante is packed with some decent action sequences. Perhaps also a first for a film shot in a foreign country. Money has been well spent on some real American stunt actors playing cops. There is also a tastefully executed strip bar song and dance number with the sexy Malaika Arora. The American cast is excellent.Has Hollywood invaded Bollywood in Kaante? There are real reasons for technical excellence in this film. Apart from the cast, direction and script writers, there is very little Bollywood presence in Kaante. Cinematography, set decoration, special effects, makeup, and almost all of the technicians in this movie are Hollywood hands. Perhaps that's why this film is so different. Sanjay Dutt and Amitabh Bachan have performed their roles faithfully well. New comer Mahesh Manjrekar puts on a commendable performance as the crazed hoodlum. I could resist comparing him to Joe Pesci in Casino while I watched him, :. We hope there is more up his sleeves in the near future. The rest of the six main characters do not share equal number of lines or screen time. There is plenty of wit and humour without trying too hard to be funny. The dialogues are natural. Actors perform effortlessly giving the impression of life. Having said all that. There are drawbacks. The script is too wordy at times. The fast paced action sometimes grind to dreaded speech session. Some minor plot holes and illogical turn of events can be noticed. I mentioned that plot introduction and character building took place during the first 6 minutes of the film. But then the story continues to build relationships even till the end of the film. During the last 1 minute of the movie we are shown some 2nd unit shots of Raj Yadav's sister in an institution. This really has little bearing on the story, and is completely unnecessary. We also learn little about Majors wife and family hence we are unable to share his emotions. Sometimes its best to leave the complex relationship building effort in the first half of a story. It tends to distract the viewer from the story line. There is even a song towards end of the film, which was quite out of place. It seems there is an unwritten law in Bollywood that a film has to be longer than two hours, regardless of whether you have the material. This film would have been lot more exciting, if it was a little shorter.  But none of the drawbacks should scare away anyone who wants to see Hindi cinema at the juncture of a major revolution. Kaante will remain an unforgettable and major step in the evolution of Hindi Cinema.","imdb_rating":0,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" And the Indian/Bollywood industry just make up their own plots.","review":"A well awaited movie I finally was able to see it and what a surprise, it's another rip off of a Hollywood movie, just in a longer version!6 strangers get arrested for one crime and end up in one jail for the night. Together they plan a flawless crime, to rob a bank. With flashbacks and some present events, we get to see who is who and how they ended up in that cell. Major, a man with an ill wife on her death bed at home is looking to get some help to get his business sorted out. Marc, a bouncer in love with one of the dancers at the club gets framed by his boss. Bali, a lunatic with a retarded sister at home has half a brain and is aided by a partner he has known for 6 months, Mac. Andy, a small time criminal who knows his way with computers and stuff, but also has trouble at home with his now divorced wife and little son who he can't support. Ajju, a crook, whose crime gets them all in jail where they meet. The robbery goes smooth, but one gets injured and they don't understand how the police arrive there until they grab a cop, who tells them that one of the 6 is an undercover cop.......For those who have seen Reservoir Dogs, you'll know who the cop is and the mystery will be solved before you know it, but still Bollywood goes all out with great songs and stuff so for those who haven't seen Reservoir Dogs, this is worth a watch.I rate this 7/10, god acting and some funny scenes.","imdb_rating":7,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" What about the American?","review":"This is a unique film in many ways, most of which have been touched upon. It is a refreshing new version of Bollywood film making. Cheers to Sanjay Gupta for taking the chance to be different.Sanjay Dutt was excellent in this film. He reminds me of Jean Reno, and hopefully this will open him up to an international audience.\nWhat I would also like to comment on is my performance as Detective Maquarrie. I busted my butt to give the audience a realistic LA detective, and did all my own stunts as well.It was a pleasure working with some of Bollywoods best, they are truly a great bunch of guys and were very profesional. Hats off to all of them for taking a chance on this film.If you have any comments, please feel free to e-mail me.I can also be seen in last years \"Windalkers\" as a marine sgt., and you will be seeing alot more of me in the future.Thanks to all that saw the film.JF Davis","imdb_rating":0,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" Excellent","review":"This movie is the best Indian film in the history of Indian cinema. the best part about this movie is the way that snajay gupta has put the songs into the film, they are not those where the hero and the heroine run off together into the hills and start to dance, the songs are related to the story in one way or another. I especially like sanjay dutts acting, to his Hindi slang to his crude acting is top performance. The way sanjay gupta has done his style by introducing what i call the \"buzz\" effect, the way he shows the power of the guns on the screen by blurring the images with a trail. And i like the storyline even though it has been copied from Hollywood, the climax is outstanding, like reservoir dogs you don't actually get involved with the characters, here in kaante you feel each and every persons reason to do the robbery, the way life has treated them amongst all this is the humour, mahesh manjrekar's performance is one of the best i have seen, he also provides the humour. Overall this is a great movie i would rate this movie 10/10","imdb_rating":10,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" Sweet & stylized. Who cares if it rips off?","review":"To say honestly, this is probably one of the best Bollywood films from recent years. Considering that it's a total ripoff (and not the first time) of Hollywood crime and gangster movies, that's saying a lot.The movie revolves around six Indian hoods living in L.A., each with a history or current involvement in crime. You have leader Major (Amitabh Bachchan), loose cannon Ajju (Sanjay Dutt), club bouncer Mark (Suneil Shetty), techie Andy (Kumar Gaurav), bumbling Bali (Mahesh Manjrekar) and his more sane partner, Mac (Lucky Ali). All of them have a desperate need for money for their own separate reasons and decide to band together and rob a bank. Upon doing so, they discover that the police were tipped off to it, and then try to discover which of them is an undercover cop.The plot can be split into three separate acts, most of the first being derived from The Usual Suspects, the second from Heat, and the third from Reservoir Dogs. The first part (having little to do with the rest of the movie) serves as a character setup, through a police interrogation about a truck, the second about the planning of the robbery, and the third as it's aftermath. Every sequence taken almost page by page off their \"inspiration.\" It's here that most would differ on the film, but I'm looking beyond.All of the actors are well cast, save perhaps Lucky Ali and Kumar Gaurav. All a great at playing the tough guy, yet also as their individual characters. Sanjay Dutt portrays an essence of total badass gangsta, and Manjrekar provides some of the film greatest laughs as a bafoon with an affinity for sex an obscene jokes.Which brings me to my next point. I have never seen an Indian movie with the amount of swearing and vulgar content as this one, probably because of it's Western source material. Don't get me wrong, I don't mind it, but it goes to extremes. I didn't get the idea of an Indian strip club nor how and why the six got to where they were. The film makes a point that there is a huge Indian crime culture in L.A., which I don't believe for a second.Wowing me were definitely some fun jokes as I mentioned above, and the centerpiece shootout with the cops, referencing almost every big action sequence in film. Mindless, but fun. The de-saturated green picture gave it a gritty look adding to the feel. And of, course, no Bollywood movie is complete without songs, and luckily this one gives us a couple memorable ones which fit the movie, and serve more as background score rather than part of the story.All in all a fun flick that in fun to look at and watch. Maybe I'm going soft on it since I am very fond of the three aforementioned Hollywood movies, but this movie takes those plot lines and makes them its own. 3/4 stars","imdb_rating":8,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" Adaptation of Reservoir Dogs.","review":"This movie is an adaptation of Quentin Tarantino's \"Reservoir Dogs\", the only difference being that there are more people in the movie. I must say, for a bollywood movie, I got more to see than I expected. I saw this movie before watching Reservoir Dogs and the performances were simply brilliant. Amitabh, Sanjay and Mahesh Manjarekar make an excellent team. If you want to relax and watch an explosive bollywood movie on a friday night, this is exactly the kind of movie you are looking for.","imdb_rating":9,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" Kaante is good Entertainer with Great performances","review":"Obviously Kaante was made for the Indian audience, not Americans.  So, it not fair to compare with a Hollywood film.  Not a perfectly made film, it does have some illogical sequences.  I saw it in a packed theater.  And going by the reaction, everybody seems to have enjoyed it.  As for me, Kaante was the most enjoyable Hindi film in a long time.  I actually felt happy after walking out of the theatre.Technically there is no Indian film that can match Kaante.  Obviously, they got technicians from Hollywood.  Right from cinematography to stunt co-coordinators to music supervisor.  Dialogues were well written, but some might complain for being too crude.  But then you don't expect gangsters to talk in Sanskrit or Urdu.Sanjay Gupta's films usually are very stylish, but very poor content wise. But this is not the case with Kaante.  The story is well developed, the second half is great.  But it is definitely inspired by two Hollywood films: Reservoir Dogs & The Usual Suspects.Performances by six lead guys are very good.  Amitabh Bachchan is very good. Sanjay Dutt is brilliant in a tailor made role.  Mahesh Manjrekar is the surprise packet.  Sunil Shetty is actually good in this film.  Kumar Gaurav & Lucky Ali does well also.  The girls have miniscule roles.\nThe thing I really liked about Kaante is that it didn't really focus on Love, Family Relations, and other clichéd rules of Indian Cinema.  It basically defies the stereotype of Indian Films.Kaante is definitely worth a watch or two.  I am going to watch it for a second time.","imdb_rating":10,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" Great film","review":"Kaante boasting of a dream star cast, is among the finest action films made in India. Though there are some loop holes in the story but the slick direction and great performances more than make up for the deficit. Technically the film seems to be flawless, with stylish direction, great music, amazing background scores and breathtaking camera work. The story is about 6 NRIs who plan to pull of a robbery, with one of them turning out to be an undercover cop. All the lead actors portray the character with great aplomb. Amitabh Bachchan is great as always as the leader of the group. Suniel Shetty, Kumar Gaurav and Lucky Ali also do a good job, but the surprise package is débutant Mahesh Mangrakar, who surprises with his amazing comic timings and keeps you alive with his one liners. But it's Sunjay Dutt who steals the show with his invincible screen presence. Though the movie is inspired by Reservior Dogs, but that doesn't stop it from being a great movie watching experience. Worth your time...!!","imdb_rating":9,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" Stylish flick that fails to live up to expectations","review":"Kaante, boasting of a millionaire star cast which includes Amitabh Bachchan, Sanjay Dutt, and Suneil Shetty, is Sanjay Gupta's latest Hollywood remake. Inspired from Quentin Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs, Bryan Singer's The Usual Suspects, and Michael Mann's Heat, the film is about six NRI Indians who come together to pull off a bank robbery. But the movie falls short of expectations, mainly due to the gaping holes in the plot. Technically, the movie is first-rate, but Gupta's overuse of style becomes the movie's weak link. It seems that Gupta tried to camouflage the movie's inherent weaknesses with style. Performance-wise, Bachchan is commanding as the leader of the group. Shetty delivers a controlled, yet polished performance. Director-turned-actor Mahesh Manjrekar impresses with his funny antics. Lucky Ali and Kumar Gaurav hold their own. But it is the deadly Dutt who steals the show with his rugged looks and menacing screen presence. Despite its shortcomings, Kaante is a perfect popcorn flick which is worth a watch. 7/10.","imdb_rating":8,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" Poor Mans Reservoir Dogs","review":"It is nothing but a slower and longer version of Reservoir Dogs with songs and dance.Nowhere touching close to the original.","imdb_rating":6,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" If you have seen \"Reservoir Dogs\", you have seen \"Kaante\"","review":"The only change is that Kaante is the Indianised version, with additional family members and some good songs thrown in. Watching the original Reservoir Dogs (director: Quentin Tarantino) after I watched Kaante made me realise that the song and dance sequences in Kaante actually thinned/watered down the pace, plot and the grip of the entire storyline. Kaante is a decent bet for your money, but then you have to hand it to the director to have come up with an original story/plot and executed is equally well.The director should have \"adapted\" with minimal changes to the pace of the story. Quentin Tarantino would not have minded I believe.","imdb_rating":0,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" OK for what it is, but doesn't have much personality of its own","review":"I'm still not quite sure why I had to wait nearly 4 years before I could see KAANTE, the Bollywood remake of Reservoir Dogs starring Amitabh Bachchan... the DVD just seemed to get held up in limbo, and eventually I stopped checking for it every month or two so I'm not sure exactly when it did finally come out.Was it worth the wait? No, not really... I might have enjoyed it more 4 years ago, but I've moved on and the times have moved on, and now it's just kind of... \"meh\".The plot is largely familiar... a group of small time crooks living in LA come together to pull off a big job... to rob the American Service Bank, the bank where all the cops have their accounts (apparently). The heist goes awry, and they suspect they have a mole in the team.RESERVOIR DOGS was already a remake itself - of Ringo Lam's CITY ON FIRE. However, Tarantino significantly changed things... switching the focus of the story from the undercover cop infiltrating a criminal gang to the gang itself, and replacing the nihilistically downbeat noir-ish vibe of CITY with a hip, street-talking post-modern sort of self-awareness (i.e. some witty dialogue). KAANTE retains the focus on the gang but largely dispenses with the wit & humour... it's a relatively straightforward tale of crime (spread out over 2.5 hours with some musical interludes, naturally).KAANTE's main claim to fame is that it was the first Indian film shot in the US... \"Bollywood Goes Hollywood\", as the box claims, and it's quite literally true. There is some attempt to explore the racism that the Indian community in LA encounter, with the police always picking them up as suspects and harassing them... this supposedly provides the motivation for them to actually commit the crime, since they're always being accused of it anyway... hmmm.Technically, the film is fairly well realised... quite slick and stylish (though the yellow filters which are used on outdoor scenes, presumably to make us think \"smog\", get a bit much). The acting is pretty good, the script is OK... the film just doesn't have much of a personality of its own. When Tarantino remade CITY ON FIRE he gave it a unique style and spin, made it into a film of its own. KAANTE doesn't seem to have such ambition - it's happy just to be \"the Bollywood remake of Reservoir Dogs\". Taken on these terms, it's not a bad effort... but the viewer may well be left wondering \"was it really necessary?\" and \"couldn't it have been something more?\".","imdb_rating":6,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" Coming from Bollywood its a surprise!","review":"Kaante is a good film if not an excellent one.Especially after going through all the same stories in each and every film one finds this film as a refreshing film and may be introduction of a martin scorsese type crime genre to the Indian film industry(it should not be taken as if I am resembling it to the martin scorsese movies but the genre is more or less very similar).So sit tight and enjoy.","imdb_rating":7,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" lives up to expectations..","review":"Yerp, this is probably 2002's most keenly anticipated bollwood film...and it clicks!thought to be a remake of reservoir dogs, this film revolves around 6 men criminals...with one traitor in them...the music in this film is no biggie, just below average...but the film's great...worth the wait...","imdb_rating":0,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" Rip-offs this poorly made aren't much fun.","review":"1/2 out of ****Kaante, Bollywood's latest attempt at imitating Hollywood, goes maybe a little too far by stealing scenes straight from many popular crime films, most particularly Reservoir Dogs along with more than a dash of The Usual Suspects and Heat. Ok, I'll be a little kinder today and call it a remake, or a re-imagining, if you will. The movie is, obviously, made for a foreign crowd that probably hasn't seen any of the aforementioned films, thus it might seem fresh to them. But I can tell you this for certain, had I not seen any of those three films, I still would have despised Kaante, simply because it's an exercise in poor filmmaking.The film begins with six men (all of them Indian) in a jail cell who have just made plans to commit a major crime, turns out it's to rob a bank. When the actual bank robbing occurs (76 minutes into the movie!), something goes terribly wrong because the police are waiting for them right outside.  After a big shootout, they make their escape and meet at the rendezvous point, but suspect one of them is an undercover cop. If you've seen Reservoir Dogs, you know where it goes from here.Right off the bat, there are problems I have with the script. What police force in their right mind would place all these criminals together in the same cell, given that they were all accused of the same crime?  It's a plot device that goes nowhere and is only introduced as a feeble reason to string these guys together. Then comes the actual planning, intercut with scenes of flashback and \"characterization,\" which takes forever considering most of the character development is obvious and cliched(only one character stands out, that's \"Major\"). As for the undercover cop, whose identity I won't reveal, it strikes as me as odd that he chooses to wait until the bank robbery to tip off the police. Wouldn't it be wiser to do it before, so mass bloodshed could be prevented?The film's centerpiece, the huge five-minute gun battle after the robbery, is obviously inspired from Heat, and it's directed in a heavily stylized, chaotic fashion. There are some nifty stunts and setpieces (the motorcycle going down the stairs, the guy sliding down the hill all the while shooting some cops, the latter obviously a signature from John Woo) and it's staged fairly well, but the director fails to put it together in a lucid fashion (outside of the gun fight, he also overstylizes the movie, obviously trying to give it a slick Hollywood look and feel, but it comes off as a second-rate music video). Everything happens too quickly and I'm still not entirely certain how all the criminals escaped without too much of a hitch.After the gun battle, we get the virtual remake of Reservoir Dogs, complete with the criminals debating what to do and who could be the cop. Obviously, their common sense isn't working since they choose to argue rather than split the money and run. There's even a scene where one of the criminals is prepared to shoot a cop they kidnapped, but is stopped by one of his co-partners, reminding him that if he kills a cop, he'll be hunted the rest of his life by the police, apparently forgetting the dozens of cops they slaughtered outside the bank. By the end, I'm not sure what it is the film is trying to do or say. As escapist entertainment, it's populated with far too many unlikeable characters and certainly doesn't feature enough outrageous action to fill up a 140-minute running time. As a character study, it's too over-the-top and shallow.  If the film was trying to suceed as both, it failed miserably.","imdb_rating":0,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" I say just see \"Reservoir Dogs\"","review":"\"Kaante\" is an Indian version of the Quentin Tarantino film, \"Reservoir Dogs\". While I can understand and appreciate that the Indian film industry would want to remake this film for domestic consumption, there are two main problems with it. The Taratino film is a classic--so good and such an important film that the director, Sanjay Guptah, is at a HUGE disadvantage and cannot possibly top the original film...or even come close to it. And, more importantly, the Indian film seems a bit sleazy, as no where in the credits does it give any credit to Tarantino...none!Like the original film, several guys meet in prison and plan a bank job. The planning is elaborate and then the plan falls apart because the cops KNEW they were coming and the final portion concerns figuring out which of them is really working for the police. All of this is right from the original and little is innovative or new. A few little points are nice (for example, I liked Amitabh Bachchan's character and motivations) but some of the new Indian touches are unwanted--such as the silly and very distracting musical numbers featuring a whole lotta strippers who keep a lot of their clothes on throughout their gyrations. Overall, I just cannot see a reason to see this film...see the original.","imdb_rating":6,"our_rating":0,"algo_label":0},{"heading":" RESEVOIR DOGS","review":"Well done, cinematography was excellent, directing was brillaint, actors was superb, but if you've seen Reservoir Dogs, the ending has been blown and you already know what's going to happen.

(If this was Hollywood film then we would all have loved it, why??).It kept me on the edge of the sit. And also, what is so amazing is that they even managed to get the normal song and dances typically seen in this so untypical film.
